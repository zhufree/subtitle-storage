0:05:13.31,0:05:14.99,but the younger one…,#A9A0FF
0:05:15.41,0:05:17.08,is rather domineering,,#A9A0FF
0:05:17.31,0:05:18.35,despite the soft features.,#A9A0FF
0:05:19.95,0:05:21.53,Perhaps they are sister and brother?,#A9A0FF

0:05:55.46,0:05:56.99,Nangong Shunu: He might not have meant it.,
0:05:57.23,0:05:58.60,Perhaps he has an urgent matter to attend to.,

0:06:03.31,0:06:04.32,His clothes are plain,,
0:06:04.32,0:06:05.43,and he carries a trunk on his back,,
0:06:05.81,0:06:07.64,so he is most likely a scholar who travelled here to take the capital exam.,
0:06:08.33,0:06:10.11,Consultation fees are not cheap in the capital,,
0:06:10.48,0:06:12.96,it could cost him a few days’ worth of food.,

0:06:25.41,0:06:26.68,the hardships of the common people?,#FF7D40
0:06:28.26,0:06:30.33,Nangong Shunu: Alright now~ Not so loud,,
0:06:30.69,0:06:32.44,we’ll be heading back after returning the folding fan,,

0:07:06.77,0:07:08.60,Let’s see who will accompany you when you’re scared of the dark then!,
0:07:09.67,0:07:11.04,Nangong Jingnu: Er-ge~,#FF7D40
0:07:14.74,0:07:15.34,Nangong Jingnu: Oh,,#FF7D40
0:07:15.34,0:07:16.21,that’s right, er-ge,,#FF7D40

0:08:07.30,0:08:08.55,You should plan ahead.,
0:08:10.46,0:08:11.10,Qi Yan: I’ve got it.,#A9A0FF
0:08:12.13,0:08:13.25,This is not a place to linger.,#A9A0FF
0:08:13.75,0:08:14.90,Unless it’s necessary,,#A9A0FF
0:08:15.58,0:08:17.93,I hope that you won’t appear in front of me again.,#A9A0FF
0:08:19.33,0:08:20.83,Wu Da: Do not forget your original goal.,

0:08:58.93,0:09:02.92,[Qi Yan opens the wooden door, closes and bars it],
0:09:12.89,0:09:21.46,[then slowly enters the house, dropping on the chair. Slowly folds up pant leg],

0:09:27.09,0:09:27.87,Though,,#A9A0FF
0:09:28.67,0:09:30.36,the way he protects his older sister,#A9A0FF
0:09:30.92,0:09:32.34,is really like Xiao-Die.,#A9A0FF

0:23:58.48,0:23:59.82,summon the soothsayer!,
0:24:00.35,0:24:01.79,Sijiu: As Your Majesty decrees!,
0:24:05.47,0:24:09.77,Sijiu: Summon the soothsayer at once!,
0:24:12.94,0:24:16.90,Guo Qingliu: This subject, soothsayer Guo Qingliu greets Your Majesty.,
0:24:17.58,0:24:18.51,Nangong Rang: Have a seat.,
0:24:19.82,0:24:20.63,Guo Qingliu: Thank you, Your Majesty.,
0:24:24.27,0:24:25.36,Sijiu: Your seat,,
0:24:25.36,0:24:26.11,Sir Guo.,
0:24:35.16,0:24:36.06,Nangong Rang: I…,
0:24:37.08,0:24:38.24,had a dream.,
0:24:39.64,0:24:42.01,Guo Qingliu: This subject is listening with all ears.,
0:24:45.55,0:24:49.89,Nangong Rang: I dreamt of a strange beast that rose from the waters,,
0:24:50.35,0:24:52.85,it came to this palace on a cloud pushed by the wind.,
0:24:53.38,0:24:56.48,It hovered above the palace for a moment at first,,
0:24:56.48,0:25:01.04,then it killed all of the imperial guards with one sneeze.,
0:25:02.38,0:25:04.56,Afterwards,,
0:25:04.56,0:25:06.50,that strange beast came towards my bedchamber.,
0:25:07.83,0:25:11.11,Accompanied by… the flickering light of fire,,
0:25:11.67,0:25:13.18,it blew the windows open,,
0:25:13.18,0:25:16.67,and it glared at me fiercely with its enormous eyes.,
0:25:18.40,0:25:23.60,The roars of that strange beast sent chills down my spine.,
0:25:27.09,0:25:27.84,Dear minister,,
0:25:28.65,0:25:30.23,what do you make of this dream?,
0:25:32.53,0:25:33.50,Guo Qingliu: Congratulations, Your Majesty,,
0:25:33.88,0:25:35.09,it is a highly auspicious sign.,
0:25:36.37,0:25:37.54,Nangong Rang: Do elaborate.,
0:25:38.09,0:25:39.64,Guo Qingliu: Your Majesty is a true draconic son of heaven,,
0:25:39.89,0:25:41.08,the father of nine sons.,
0:25:41.31,0:25:44.99,The noble blood of a true dragon can easily subdue strange beasts.,
0:25:46.00,0:25:48.21,Though that strange beast was unstoppable,,
0:25:48.61,0:25:51.10,it stopped in front of Your Majesty in the end,,
0:25:51.10,0:25:53.41,and it did not harm Your Majesty.,
0:25:54.00,0:25:56.09,The great exam is only a few days away,,
0:25:56.39,0:25:58.98,this subject will boldly offer a prediction…,
0:25:59.92,0:26:04.28,A remarkable talent for the ages will appear in this year’s palace exam.,
0:26:12.22,0:26:13.50,Nangong Rang: You may go now.,
0:26:13.50,0:26:14.03,Guo Qingliu: Understood.,
0:26:22.98,0:26:24.86,Nangong Rang: A remarkable talent for the ages…?,
0:26:26.52,0:26:31.94,But this dream still unsettles me…,
0:26:56.90,0:26:57.61,Ding You: Long time no see,,
0:26:58.26,0:26:58.80,Qi Yan.,
0:26:59.26,0:27:00.04,Qi Yan: Ding You?,#A9A0FF
0:27:01.29,0:27:04.09,What are you doing here instead of staying in the imperial hospital?,#A9A0FF
0:27:05.03,0:27:06.31,Ding You: I have my own reasons.,
0:27:07.32,0:27:07.85,Qi Yan: Come in.,#A9A0FF
0:27:13.72,0:27:14.63,Ding You: You on the other hand,,
0:27:15.37,0:27:19.16,why are you awake in the middle of the night watching a fire in the courtyard?,
0:27:20.21,0:27:23.57,Could it be that… you’ve learned how to foretell the future,,
0:27:24.18,0:27:27.03,so you’re waiting for me ahead of time?,
0:27:29.44,0:27:32.04,Qi Yan: Is there ever really such a thing as predicting the future?,#A9A0FF
0:27:34.51,0:27:37.00,You didn’t get followed on the way here, right?,#A9A0FF
0:27:37.31,0:27:38.17,Ding You: Relax,,
0:27:38.88,0:27:39.95,it’s the middle of the night,,
0:27:40.33,0:27:41.69,and your place is so far out…,
0:27:42.84,0:27:44.21,And besides, it’s my rest day,,
0:27:45.43,0:27:47.65,who will pay any mind to the whereabouts of a mere imperial doctor?,
0:27:48.55,0:27:49.32,Qi Yan: That’s good.,#A9A0FF
0:27:50.69,0:27:51.89,The great exam is almost here,,#A9A0FF
0:27:52.28,0:27:53.51,whether I succeed or fail depends entirely on this event.,#A9A0FF
0:27:54.07,0:27:55.75,I don’t want anything to go wrong.,#A9A0FF
0:27:57.77,0:27:59.21,Ding You: Your health is weak,,
0:27:59.77,0:28:03.22,what are you doing out in the courtyard where it’s damp and chilly?,
0:28:05.37,0:28:06.84,Qi Yan: In recent years…,#A9A0FF
0:28:07.43,0:28:08.65,everything has changed.,#A9A0FF
0:28:10.29,0:28:14.50,Only the starry sky above remains the same as it ever was.,#A9A0FF
0:28:17.33,0:28:18.68,It’s just a shame that…,#A9A0FF
0:28:19.85,0:28:21.47,I’ll hardly have the opportunity,#A9A0FF
0:28:22.50,0:28:24.49,to appreciate it from now on.,#A9A0FF
0:28:25.39,0:28:26.45,Ding You: And why is that?,
0:28:27.34,0:28:30.16,Qi Yan: I need an explanation for my uncommon eye color after all.,#A9A0FF
0:28:31.66,0:28:34.29,Fortunately, Shifu arranged my family registration to be in the Jin province,,#A9A0FF
0:28:35.62,0:28:40.27,so I made use of the deadly plague in Jingjia First Year for my story.,#A9A0FF
0:28:41.72,0:28:45.81,I can just say that I almost lost my life to it as a child,,#A9A0FF
0:28:47.21,0:28:49.18,and I somehow made it out alive,,#A9A0FF
0:28:50.10,0:28:54.65,only to have my eyes permanently changed by the illness.,#A9A0FF
0:28:56.15,0:28:57.52,Not only in color,,#A9A0FF
0:28:58.10,0:28:59.80,but my vision becomes impaired at night as well,,#A9A0FF
0:29:00.16,0:29:01.54,and I can’t take any wine.,#A9A0FF
0:29:03.63,0:29:05.22,By the time the exam results are published,,#A9A0FF
0:29:05.80,0:29:08.09,this should become known as well…,#A9A0FF
0:29:12.32,0:29:18.14,How can someone who cannot see at night gaze upon the starry sky?,#A9A0FF
0:29:20.47,0:29:22.09,Ding You: Although it’s a good cover,,
0:29:22.59,0:29:24.18,it could become troublesome for you in other ways as well.,
0:29:25.90,0:29:27.24,Even if you want to take revenge,,
0:29:27.64,0:29:29.83,you should at least make life more comfortable for yourself.,
0:29:31.19,0:29:32.62,Why make it harder?,
0:29:34.12,0:29:35.05,Qi Yan: Harder?,#A9A0FF
0:29:37.21,0:29:38.87,The Wei kingdom’s court is corrupt,,#A9A0FF
0:29:39.72,0:29:43.35,new graduates are bound to be pulled in different directions by various factions.,#A9A0FF
0:29:44.50,0:29:46.15,I will have to socialize when the time comes.,#A9A0FF
0:29:47.21,0:29:50.69,This cover will actually save me plenty of trouble instead.,#A9A0FF
0:29:51.69,0:29:53.90,I’m certain that I don’t have an absurdly high capacity for alcohol,,#A9A0FF
0:29:54.66,0:29:56.81,so it would be better not to touch any at all,,#A9A0FF
0:29:57.93,0:30:00.79,to avoid any potential mistakes made in a lack of sobriety.,#A9A0FF
0:30:02.35,0:30:03.44,Ding You: I’m not as smart as you,,
0:30:04.18,0:30:06.12,nor do I have a foresight like yours.,
0:30:09.58,0:30:11.20,All I have is some skill in medicine,,
0:30:12.07,0:30:13.13,but I hope I can be of help to you.,
0:30:14.35,0:30:18.57,Qi Yan: I hope you didn’t come here in the middle of the night just to reminisce?,#A9A0FF
0:30:21.98,0:30:23.07,Ding You: Of course not,,
0:30:24.30,0:30:27.37,I’m here at this hour to tell you two things.,
0:30:28.96,0:30:31.56,One is that I have a solid foothold in the imperial hospital now,,
0:30:32.20,0:30:33.53,so you can go ahead and do what you need to.,
0:30:35.19,0:30:37.17,Even if you become a minister of high position one day,,
0:30:37.57,0:30:38.45,there’s no need to worry,,
0:30:39.74,0:30:41.79,I will find a way to serve as your imperial doctor.,
0:30:44.09,0:30:45.05,And the other thing is…,
0:30:47.00,0:30:48.18,a word from the master.,
0:30:49.17,0:30:50.30,Qi Yan: What did Shifu say?,#A9A0FF
0:30:51.47,0:30:52.72,Ding You: Master wanted me to tell you that,
0:30:53.56,0:30:57.68,old thief Nangong loves to fool public opinion by doing things for fame and prestige.,
0:30:58.83,0:31:01.04,There has been an increase in taxes and levies in recent years,,
0:31:01.57,0:31:02.62,and people have been complaining for a long time.,
0:31:04.18,0:31:05.56,In order to appease the public,,
0:31:06.11,0:31:08.04,there will definitely be a commoner,
0:31:08.54,0:31:10.81,among the top three graduates of the palace exam this year.,
0:31:11.72,0:31:14.15,The palace exam only allows for four hours of marking.,
0:31:14.78,0:31:17.11,Old thief Nangong won’t be able to read each essay carefully,,
0:31:17.59,0:31:20.58,that is why effort must be put into the penmanship!,
0:31:21.95,0:31:26.27,The master personally taught you calligraphy for this very purpose,,
0:31:29.11,0:31:30.50,but it won’t hurt to be careful.,
0:31:31.41,0:31:32.50,Your success hinges on this!,
0:31:33.75,0:31:34.52,Qi Yan: I’ve got it.,#A9A0FF
0:31:35.11,0:31:37.34,Tell Shifu to rest assured.,#A9A0FF
0:31:39.35,0:31:40.60,Ding You: Master also said that,
0:31:41.17,0:31:43.78, although the Champion, Board’s Eye, and Flower Seeker,
0:31:43.78,0:31:45.03,are the same rank,,
0:31:45.96,0:31:49.46,there has been an unwritten rule since the previous dynasty,
0:31:50.33,0:31:52.22, where the title of Flower Seeker will only be given to those,
0:31:52.22,0:31:54.19,who are excellent in both studies and appearances.,
0:31:55.18,0:31:56.77,Ministers in the court,
0:31:56.77,0:31:58.54,also love to ask for His Majesty to grant marriages,,
0:31:58.54,0:32:00.45,putting Flower Seekers into their estates as son-in-laws.,
0:32:01.32,0:32:03.31,You must be careful…,
0:32:03.31,0:32:05.12,Do not get marked as Flower Seeker.,
0:32:06.45,0:32:07.46,Qi Yan: I’ve got it.,#A9A0FF
0:32:08.82,0:32:10.13,It’s getting late,,#A9A0FF
0:32:10.51,0:32:11.41,I won’t be escorting you.,#A9A0FF
0:32:13.10,0:32:16.05,Ding You: You know, we did grow up together after all,,
0:32:16.05,0:32:18.36,and we haven’t seen each other for three years. I won’t say anything about catching up,,
0:32:18.36,0:32:19.70,but the way you’re chasing me out…,
0:32:24.41,0:32:25.12,Qi Yan: Ding You!,#A9A0FF
0:32:25.93,0:32:26.61,Ding You: What,,
0:32:27.42,0:32:28.10,regretting it already?,
0:32:29.26,0:32:30.58,Want me to stay a while longer?,
0:32:32.09,0:32:34.78,Qi Yan: I’ve already told you this three years ago,,#A9A0FF
0:32:34.78,0:32:35.89,when I saw you out of the nameless valley.,#A9A0FF
0:32:36.55,0:32:38.07,Qiyan Aguna is already dead,,#A9A0FF
0:32:39.02,0:32:40.69,there is only Qi Yan in this world.,#A9A0FF
0:32:42.17,0:32:43.72,Once you walk out that door today,,#A9A0FF
0:32:44.44,0:32:45.61,imperial doctor Ding You,#A9A0FF
0:32:45.61,0:32:47.55,and Jin province scholar Qi Yan,#A9A0FF
0:32:47.55,0:32:49.04,will be complete strangers.,#A9A0FF
0:32:50.01,0:32:51.42,Do keep that in mind.,#A9A0FF
