0:17:20.45,0:17:22.40,occupying numerous pastures,,
0:17:22.77,0:17:25.15,looting estates and military supplies.,
0:17:26.45,0:17:28.10,After the Yi province,,
0:17:28.37,0:17:30.67,the Qing province is in imminent danger.,
0:17:31.17,0:17:33.75,I have already ordered the Zhenbei General Shangguan Wu,
0:17:33.75,0:17:36.27,to return to the You province to quell the rebellion,,
0:17:37.30,0:17:42.02,but the tribespeople are gathering like locusts.,
0:17:43.55,0:17:47.12,What should the court do in response?,
0:17:48.72,0:17:51.57,I invite every official to offer their opinion,,

0:18:02.20,0:18:04.60,the tribespeople are cruel by nature,,
0:18:04.60,0:18:07.75,they have massacred the local people in every land they reach.,
0:18:08.57,0:18:11.82,The people in the northern nine provinces now live in terror,,
0:18:11.82,0:18:14.30,and many common folks have begun to leave their homes.,
0:18:15.00,0:18:16.60,If this continues,,
0:18:16.72,0:18:21.15,the eighty-one counties in the northern nine provinces will be reduced to empty cities.,
0:18:21.77,0:18:26.35,More than a decade’s worth of investment by the court will go down the drain.,
0:18:26.80,0:18:30.77,The fortified cities we’ve built will end up in the hands of another.,
0:18:31.85,0:18:38.40,The silver that Your Majesty has given to incentivize the common folks to move to the north will be for naught.,

0:18:40.62,0:18:43.75,regardless if the tribespeople are a formidable threat or not,,
0:18:44.22,0:18:47.40,the court should take this opportunity to send troops to eradicate the tribespeople,,

0:18:51.95,0:18:55.32,Otherwise… we will lose provinces in the best case,,

0:20:02.35,0:20:03.77,In this subject’s opinion,,
0:20:03.77,0:20:08.67,the court should send a few imperial envoys to the nine provinces to appease the public,,
0:20:08.67,0:20:11.80,and the various provinces should increase their defenses,
