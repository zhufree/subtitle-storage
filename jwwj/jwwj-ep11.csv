0:04:56.16,0:04:57.59,an inner subject may not interfere in politics.,#A9A0FF
0:04:58.34,0:05:01.58,But the Gongyang estate’s oldest young master works in the grand archive,,#A9A0FF
0:05:02.01,0:05:04.06,and Baishi was only given a minor position.,#A9A0FF
0:05:04.06,0:05:05.37,He has no qualifications to meet the Emperor.,#A9A0FF
0:05:06.16,0:05:08.02,Due to the gravity of the situation,,#A9A0FF
0:05:08.32,0:05:10.58,the major officials of the court chose to remain silent.,#A9A0FF

0:05:37.88,0:05:40.59,I don’t think that warrants a death sentence.,#FF7D40
0:05:41.63,0:05:42.52,But…,#FF7D40
0:05:43.07,0:05:45.08,Emperor Father firmly believes in superstition.,#FF7D40
0:05:45.20,0:05:50.35,Considering that the Weiming palace and the ancestral mountain burned down almost at the same time,,#FF7D40
0:05:50.58,0:05:52.93,such a decision isn’t that unlikely.,#FF7D40

0:11:24.21,0:11:25.92,His Highness does not hold it against you.,
0:11:27.16,0:11:27.71,Here…,
0:11:28.36,0:11:30.15,This is a letter His Highness has written for you.,
0:11:30.81,0:11:32.98,It is about all of the recent events in the court.,
0:11:33.77,0:11:35.93,His Highness wants you to burn it immediately after reading,,
0:11:36.46,0:11:38.99,and I will relay anything you wish to say to him.,
0:11:39.28,0:11:41.10,Qi Yan: Alright, I’ll take a look first.,#A9A0FF
0:11:41.53,0:11:46.70,[Qi Yan tears the letter open, then unfolds the letter],
0:11:50.81,0:11:52.18,Qi Yan: **Xing Jingfu!**,#A9A0FF
0:11:53.00,0:11:55.11,**He actually dared to propose a purge on the Jing people!**,#A9A0FF
0:12:02.81,0:12:06.91,Qi Yan: Secretariat Xing’s proposal to purge the Jing people…,#A9A0FF
0:12:08.13,0:12:09.91,was actually adopted by His Majesty too?,#A9A0FF
0:12:10.44,0:12:11.24,Xie An: Yes.,
0:12:12.03,0:12:16.22,There are no longer Jing slaves being sold in every mule and horse market within the capital city,,
0:12:16.58,0:12:18.07,all of them have been dragged away and killed.,
0:12:19.01,0:12:21.10,Those dregs of the Jing kingdom have formed a rebellion,,
0:12:21.10,0:12:22.23,killing anyone they see,,
0:12:22.88,0:12:25.34,creating huge losses for the Qing and Yi provinces.,
0:12:26.21,0:12:29.09,It’s only natural for His Majesty to do so.,
0:12:30.42,0:12:33.32,Does worthy brother have a stratagem regarding this matter?,
0:12:36.12,0:12:37.93,Qi Yan: **It’s only natural, he says!**,#A9A0FF
0:12:40.98,0:12:41.56,Qi Yan: Hm,,#A9A0FF
0:12:43.02,0:12:44.21, I was just thinking…,#A9A0FF
0:12:45.11,0:12:46.65,Now that the weather is warming up,,#A9A0FF
0:12:47.55,0:12:49.59,with so much dead and injured in the Qing and Yi provinces,,#A9A0FF
0:12:49.94,0:12:51.56,an outbreak might occur.,#A9A0FF
0:12:52.73,0:12:53.87,You know this as well…,#A9A0FF
0:12:54.24,0:12:55.59,I was born in the Jin province,,#A9A0FF
0:12:56.10,0:12:58.05,I’ve seen devastation.,#A9A0FF
0:13:05.35,0:13:06.55,Xie An: That’s not something we can help with.,
0:13:07.91,0:13:10.59,Those Jing slaves were enslaved for over a decade.,
0:13:11.21,0:13:13.31,Other than those who surrendered immediately,,
0:13:14.11,0:13:15.87,the rest are remnants of a population.,
0:13:16.17,0:13:19.60,No matter if they were bought by others or were physically strong,,
0:13:19.60,0:13:22.06,all of them had crawled out from a mountain of corpses,,
0:13:22.64,0:13:25.01,they can’t possibly hate us more.,
0:13:25.85,0:13:27.16,Armed with weapons and war horses,,
0:13:27.30,0:13:29.18,not even the old and young are spared.,
0:13:29.33,0:13:30.71,They leave only death in their wake!,
0:13:31.41,0:13:31.87,Hmph,,
0:13:32.64,0:13:34.84,if I must say… A purge is good as well,,
0:13:34.94,0:13:36.33,it’ll save us from more trouble in the future.,
0:13:37.45,0:13:40.78,People of a different kind are not to be trusted after all.,
0:13:44.47,0:13:46.04,Qi Yan: I… On the contrary,,#A9A0FF
0:13:46.89,0:13:48.66,I think that this is a good opportunity.,#A9A0FF
0:13:49.45,0:13:51.79,Xie An: Oh, how so?,
0:13:52.52,0:13:54.53,Qi Yan: The Qing and Yi provinces have suffered grave losses,,#A9A0FF
0:13:54.86,0:13:57.90,there is bound to be a lot of resentment and panic building in the area.,#A9A0FF
0:13:58.92,0:14:02.16,This is a good opportunity for the Third Highness to establish himself!,#A9A0FF
0:14:03.44,0:14:05.03,Xie An: Please elaborate, worthy brother.,
0:14:10.92,0:14:14.47,Qi Yan: Though the Third Highness is outstanding among the many Princes,,#A9A0FF
0:14:15.00,0:14:17.90,living deep in the imperial palace leaves him with no reputation in the world of commoners.,#A9A0FF
0:14:18.87,0:14:20.27,In a time of crisis,,#A9A0FF
0:14:20.58,0:14:22.55,if the Third Highness heads to the northern nine provinces in person,#A9A0FF
0:14:22.74,0:14:23.78,to reassure the people,#A9A0FF
0:14:24.11,0:14:25.90,and help to rebuild their homes,,#A9A0FF
0:14:26.33,0:14:28.41,he will surely earn a reputation of ‘benevolence’.,#A9A0FF
0:14:30.10,0:14:32.09,The Third Highness is neither legitimate nor the eldest,,#A9A0FF
0:14:32.86,0:14:34.28,if he wants to fulfil his ambition,,#A9A0FF
0:14:34.55,0:14:37.78,just the support of the officials and His Majesty’s favor is not enough.,#A9A0FF
0:14:39.07,0:14:41.36,There is presently a void in the kingdom’s treasury,,#A9A0FF
0:14:41.86,0:14:43.36,but the Third Highness has you,,#A9A0FF
0:14:43.36,0:14:45.83,the wealthiest man in the Wei kingdom, assisting him.,#A9A0FF
0:14:46.33,0:14:48.53,There is no better candidate to provide relief to the people in need!,#A9A0FF
0:14:51.09,0:14:52.88,Xie An: Worthy brother is right,,
0:14:54.02,0:14:54.62,but…,
0:14:55.81,0:14:57.42,Qi Yan: There is no need for apprehension,,#A9A0FF
0:14:57.96,0:15:00.08,no one else will know about this.,#A9A0FF
0:15:01.67,0:15:05.63,Xie An: Worthy brother, I am the one who recommended you to His Highness.,
0:15:05.98,0:15:08.94,You and I share all glory and ruin.,
0:15:09.79,0:15:13.03,I can only gasp in amazement at your schemes and tactics,,
0:15:14.21,0:15:15.97,but when it comes to judging people,,
0:15:16.87,0:15:18.82,I am slightly ahead of you.,
0:15:20.05,0:15:23.65,Your suggestion, I will relay to his Highness word-for-word.,
0:15:24.40,0:15:25.88,I know that you have a proud backbone,,
0:15:26.07,0:15:27.49,so I’ll let you know upfront that,
0:15:28.27,0:15:31.43,His Highness will likely not adopt your proposal.,
0:15:31.62,0:15:32.52,Qi Yan: Why not?,#A9A0FF
0:15:33.32,0:15:35.34,Xie An: The situation in the court changes like the clouds.,
0:15:35.44,0:15:40.25,How can His Highness possibly leave over such insubstantial things at a time like this?,
0:15:40.78,0:15:43.87,If he leaves, would that not leave the court to old two and old four?,
0:15:45.27,0:15:46.02,Additionally…,
0:15:46.80,0:15:48.94,the northern nine provinces are hell on earth right now.,
0:15:49.41,0:15:51.68,A trip there will take at least half a year.,
0:15:52.90,0:15:55.87,His Highness… is accustomed to a life of luxury.,
0:15:56.86,0:15:59.74,Qi Yan: Ai, what a shame.,#A9A0FF
0:15:59.74,0:16:00.44,It really is.,#A9A0FF
0:16:01.39,0:16:02.59,Xie An: Indeed.,
0:16:03.87,0:16:06.62,But His Highness is very satisfied with your previous stratagem.,
0:16:11.17,0:16:13.48,Do you have any words for me to relay, worthy brother?,
0:16:14.62,0:16:15.93,Qi Yan: Let me think about it.,#A9A0FF
0:16:17.40,0:16:19.62,It’s getting late, I will be returning to the estate.,#A9A0FF
0:16:20.73,0:16:21.62,There is no need to escort.,#A9A0FF
0:16:23.07,0:16:25.97,Xie An: Alright, then I won’t be escorting you.,
0:16:26.48,0:16:27.16,Qi Yan: Goodbye!,#A9A0FF
