0:09:31.11,0:09:32.61,You’re too young to understand.,

0:10:10.56,0:10:12.12,Even if the master is wrong,,
0:10:12.12,0:10:14.03,so what if she must carry the blame?,

0:10:24.21,0:10:25.86,If she couldn’t even bear a little grievance,,

0:10:35.57,0:10:37.56,How fortunate that you have Emperor Father’s love,,
0:10:37.87,0:10:39.95,and that she was a servant born in the original estate,,
0:10:40.28,0:10:41.70,or this could have caused a storm.,
0:10:42.92,0:10:45.11,Do you know… If you were a Prince,,
0:10:45.67,0:10:48.60,if those nefarious ones seized upon a minor issue like this,,
0:10:49.12,0:10:51.50,you could be doomed forever!,

0:10:56.63,0:10:57.48,da-jie, I understand now.,
0:10:59.22,0:11:00.38,Nangong Sunu: Xiao-mei,,
0:11:01.07,0:11:02.43,because of Chuntao’s death,,
0:11:02.98,0:11:04.94,you’ve been avoiding your Fuma with or without the intention to.,
0:11:05.57,0:11:07.36,Do you really think he can’t tell?,
0:11:08.55,0:11:11.15,Have you ever wondered if he might feel upset,,
0:11:11.58,0:11:13.50,or what he feels?,
0:11:14.94,0:11:16.12,When it comes down to it,,
0:11:16.34,0:11:18.05,it isn’t easy for him either.,
0:11:18.80,0:11:20.56,Brother-in-law isn’t like your big brother-in-law.,
0:11:21.05,0:11:22.82,No matter how you put it, he is a General,
0:11:22.82,0:11:24.01,who succeeded a legacy of defending the borders.,
0:11:25.01,0:11:27.03,For Fumas in the capital city,,
0:11:27.30,0:11:29.33,all of their honor and glory come from the Princess.,
0:11:30.10,0:11:33.14,Now, you are distancing yourself from him over a servant girl.,
0:11:33.40,0:11:37.03,Could it be that you think he was the one behind Chuntao’s death?,
0:11:37.72,0:11:39.35,Nangong Jingnu: I don’t,,#FF7D40
0:11:39.49,0:11:41.05,why would I think that?,#FF7D40
0:11:41.88,0:11:44.46,I, it’s just that whenever I see him,,#FF7D40
0:11:45.07,0:11:46.26,I’d feel bad inside.,#FF7D40
0:11:47.05,0:11:48.76,I want to have a little more time.,#FF7D40
0:11:49.53,0:11:51.62,Nangong Sunu: As imperial descendants,,
0:11:51.62,0:11:53.61,how we live is a whole subject in itself.,
0:11:54.46,0:11:56.26,Just take the treatment towards a Fuma as an example.,
0:11:56.61,0:11:59.63,Finding the right balance alone is enough to take you both a few years to learn.,
0:12:00.89,0:12:03.52,The clever ones will find it within a couple of years,,
0:12:03.95,0:12:06.30,while the foolish ones will never learn it in their lifetime.,
0:12:07.09,0:12:09.12,There are so many Princesses throughout history.,
0:12:09.39,0:12:12.10,Why were some in loving and harmonious marriages,,
0:12:12.43,0:12:15.17,while others were united in appearances but divided at heart?,
0:12:16.43,0:12:17.76,In front of the Fuma,,
0:12:17.89,0:12:19.43,you should not keep up the airs of a Princess,,
0:12:19.87,0:12:21.94,but a suitable amount of presence as royalty is needed.,
0:12:22.98,0:12:27.01,It’s fine to give the Fuma some face over inconsequential matters,,
0:12:27.44,0:12:28.92,but when it comes to important issues,,
0:12:28.92,0:12:30.70,you must stand firm.,
0:12:32.47,0:12:34.78,Oh you, how are you going to have a child of your own,
0:12:34.78,0:12:36.47,if you keep this up?,

0:12:48.82,0:12:50.87,You should just light the lantern tonight.,
0:12:51.19,0:12:52.31,When a married couple fights,,
0:12:52.31,0:12:54.05,the argument starts before bed, and ends after it.,

0:32:42.09,0:32:42.91,Qi Yan: **Oh no…**,#A9A0FF
0:32:43.72,0:32:44.54,Nangong Rang: What about him?,
0:32:45.31,0:32:46.82,Jiya: The leader of the rebels, that nefarious General,,
0:32:47.21,0:32:49.54,is not actually the Prince of the Chengli tribe, Qiyan Aguna…,
0:32:51.10,0:32:52.19,When I was little,,
0:32:52.19,0:32:54.10,ah-ba once took me on a visit to the Chengli tribe.,
0:32:55.10,0:32:57.47,Sukhbarun’s Khatun was from the Wei kingdom,,
0:32:57.88,0:33:01.13,so his son and daughter did not actually have pure blood.,
0:33:02.22,0:33:03.89,The Prince, Qiyan Aguna,,
0:33:04.37,0:33:06.24,had a tall and sturdy build,,
0:33:06.69,0:33:07.87,but he had black eyes.,
0:33:08.71,0:33:10.37,His younger sister, Qiyan Nomin,,
0:33:11.01,0:33:13.39,had amber eyes,,
0:33:14.40,0:33:16.73,but she was physically frail.,
0:33:17.97,0:33:20.16,The nefarious General charged into Baishui city that day,,
0:33:20.16,0:33:20.98,so I’ve seen him.,
0:33:21.96,0:33:23.96,He had amber eyes,,
0:33:24.46,0:33:26.19,so he couldn’t possibly be Qiyan Aguna.,
0:33:29.28,0:33:30.76,Nangong Rang: You mean…,
0:33:31.00,0:33:33.21,someone is using this to build momentum?,
0:33:34.08,0:33:36.38,Jiya: Although Qiyan Aguna was young back then,,
0:33:36.94,0:33:39.27,he was known for having a divine gift,,
0:33:39.75,0:33:41.64,and he was the only Prince of the Chengli tribe.,
0:33:42.81,0:33:46.89,This name held some weight among the people of the grass plains.,
0:33:48.08,0:33:50.15,The real Qiyan Aguna,,
0:33:50.54,0:33:51.80,I think, must be dead.,
0:33:52.64,0:33:55.69,He was not the type to stay in hiding.,
0:33:56.42,0:33:57.08,Nangong Rang: Oh,,
0:33:57.79,0:33:58.68,all the better if he’s dead.,
0:33:59.70,0:34:00.22,Come,,
0:34:00.85,0:34:03.70,let us all drink to our heart’s content tonight!,
0:34:04.05,0:34:05.04,Jiya: Hehehe.,
0:34:09.74,0:34:11.91,[Jiya and Qi Yan measure each other up discreetly],
0:34:12.71,0:34:14.75,Qi Yan: **Jiya does recognize me,**,#A9A0FF
0:34:15.25,0:34:18.73,**but why did she intentionally swap the description of my features with Xiao-Die’s?**,#A9A0FF
0:34:19.94,0:34:21.85,**Is she trying to cover for me,**,#A9A0FF
0:34:22.35,0:34:24.07,**or does she have other plans?**,#A9A0FF
0:34:25.07,0:34:26.85,Jiya: **It’s been eleven years.**,
0:34:27.15,0:34:28.69,**He still looks the same as he was as a child,**,
0:34:30.06,0:34:31.52,**but he has grown taller,**,
0:34:32.27,0:34:33.88,**and his features have become finer.**,
0:34:34.56,0:34:36.84,**His body is still so thin…**,
0:34:38.07,0:34:40.42,**There’s a scar on his face for some reason,**,
0:34:41.13,0:34:43.55,**but it does make him look more like a Prince.**,
0:34:49.54,0:34:53.66,Qi Yan: **You came to the capital city and became a consort,**,#A9A0FF
0:34:49.54,0:34:53.66,Jiya: **You came to the capital city and became a Fuma,**,
0:34:54.92,0:34:57.14,**what exactly is your goal?**,#A9A0FF
0:34:54.92,0:34:57.14,**what exactly is your goal?**,
