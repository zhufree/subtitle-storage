0:37:12.43,0:37:15.27,Xie An: Aiya, is this necessary, worthy brother?,
0:37:15.62,0:37:18.22,I know that His Highness not volunteering himself,
0:37:18.22,0:37:20.38,for the disaster clean-up as you advised,
0:37:20.38,0:37:21.26,disappointed you,,
0:37:21.48,0:37:23.55,but His Highness regrets it as well.,

0:37:28.54,0:37:31.49,Worthy brother, you have a brilliant mind, you leave nothing unconsidered.,
0:37:31.69,0:37:34.29,Our Highness is still young after all.,
0:37:34.66,0:37:37.79,He did not understand at the time, thinking it to be a difficult chore.,
0:37:38.60,0:37:39.98,It was only when the Second Prince volunteered,,
0:37:39.98,0:37:41.92,seizing the opportunity that he had a realization!,
0:37:42.26,0:37:43.76,He already regrets it,,
0:37:44.15,0:37:46.04,oh how he regrets not listening to your advice!,
0:37:48.22,0:37:50.80,Qi Yan: Hah, the Third Highness must have as many aides in his estate as there are clouds in the sky.,#A9A0FF
0:37:50.80,0:37:53.25,He no longer has eyes for a counselor in common clothes like me.,#A9A0FF
0:37:54.60,0:37:56.31,What a waste of my loyalty.,#A9A0FF
0:37:57.12,0:37:59.03,How dangerous is this path?,#A9A0FF
0:37:59.42,0:38:02.16,One wrong step is all it takes!,#A9A0FF
0:38:02.44,0:38:05.33,Xie An: Yes, yes, worthy brother is right!,
0:38:05.93,0:38:07.71,How is worthy brother the wearer of common clothes,,

0:38:10.34,0:38:11.43,virtuous and talented.,
0:38:12.97,0:38:13.82,Worthy brother…,
0:38:14.12,0:38:15.06,You understand this as well.,
0:38:15.68,0:38:17.66,There is no coming back from what we are striving to achieve.,
0:38:18.05,0:38:18.86,If we succeed,,
0:38:19.09,0:38:21.09,we will be ministers of merit for the new court.,
0:38:21.48,0:38:22.50,If we fail,,
0:38:23.09,0:38:25.09,it’s over for us!,
0:38:25.87,0:38:28.41,Worthy brother, worthy brother!,
0:38:28.98,0:38:29.65,Qi Yan: Forget it.,#A9A0FF
0:38:30.78,0:38:32.86,A scholar will give his life for those who understand him.,#A9A0FF
0:38:33.64,0:38:36.44,Tell me, what is the current situation?,#A9A0FF
0:38:38.96,0:38:40.46,Xie An: Who knows if that rotten log of the Second Highness,
0:38:41.00,0:38:44.29,found some talent who gave him this fine idea or not,,
0:38:44.80,0:38:47.26,but he is very likely to get back on his feet this time.,
0:38:48.34,0:38:49.56,Ever since he went to the north of Luo,,
0:38:49.99,0:38:50.86,he has been working actively in disaster aid,,
0:38:51.39,0:38:54.16,putting the Qing and Yi provinces in good order,,
0:38:54.51,0:38:56.77,and he has even sold the valuables accumulated in his estate,
0:38:56.90,0:38:58.92,and exchanged a year of his fiefs,
0:38:59.18,0:39:01.16,to copper coins and supplies,,
0:39:01.16,0:39:02.74,distributing them to the families of victims,
0:39:02.98,0:39:05.06,and the impacted folks in nearby provinces.,
0:39:06.83,0:39:07.87,Apparently…,
0:39:08.02,0:39:11.95,Nangong Wei also dug burial pits with the soldiers himself.,
0:39:12.47,0:39:14.06,He wrote a memorial of ten thousand words for the common folks,
0:39:14.06,0:39:15.45,who lost their lives in the conflict,,
0:39:15.73,0:39:17.90,and ordered a craftsman to engrave it on stone.,
0:39:18.66,0:39:19.70,On the day of burial,,
0:39:19.70,0:39:20.94,in the name of His Majesty,,
0:39:20.94,0:39:22.22,he offered three animal sacrifices,
0:39:22.57,0:39:23.78,and gave a bow of courtesy.,
0:39:24.96,0:39:28.32,Xie An: Every single one of these deeds reached the capital city quickly,,
0:39:28.58,0:39:30.56,as if they’ve grown wings.,
0:39:31.32,0:39:33.38,Be it the world of commoners or the court,,
0:39:33.84,0:39:35.49,the Second Highness’ reputation has reached extreme heights.,
0:39:36.29,0:39:37.36,Worthy brother…,
0:39:37.73,0:39:39.14,Please think of something quickly!,
0:39:39.94,0:39:43.09,Qi Yan: So there is a skilled person behind the Second Highness offering advice,,#A9A0FF
0:39:43.94,0:39:45.28,these are great plans.,#A9A0FF
0:39:45.91,0:39:46.69,Xie An: Worthy brother,,
0:39:47.21,0:39:48.10,this is a serious matter,,
0:39:48.32,0:39:49.80,you have to think of something quickly.,
0:39:50.88,0:39:53.04,Qi Yan: Brother Yuanshan, forgive my boldness,,#A9A0FF
0:39:54.08,0:39:55.57,but I’d like to know exactly,#A9A0FF
0:39:55.57,0:39:58.20,how much authority the Third Highness has given you,,#A9A0FF
0:39:58.49,0:39:59.48,and how much trust?,#A9A0FF
0:40:01.09,0:40:02.61,What I am about to say,#A9A0FF
0:40:02.83,0:40:04.44,could be the difference between success and failure,,#A9A0FF
0:40:05.19,0:40:06.17,can you handle it?,#A9A0FF
0:40:06.69,0:40:07.82,Xie An: Rest assured, worthy brother.,
0:40:08.28,0:40:09.62,His Highness does not suspect his subordinates,,
0:40:09.62,0:40:10.65,and he would not employ those he suspects.,
0:40:11.21,0:40:14.43,I, Xie An, have already bound my life and all that I have to His Highness.,
0:40:15.73,0:40:19.29,His Highness is truly having a hard time at the present,,
0:40:19.94,0:40:22.40,otherwise he would have come to see you in person.,
0:40:23.13,0:40:24.13,Qi Yan: In that case,,#A9A0FF
0:40:24.43,0:40:27.63,I have a poem and a message for His Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:40:28.32,0:40:31.30,I’ll trouble brother Yuanshan to take the brush and write this poem down.,#A9A0FF
0:40:31.99,0:40:33.01,Xie An: Alright, alright.,
0:40:41.22,0:40:46.15,Qi Yan: A pair of suns hung in the sky,,#A9A0FF
0:40:46.15,0:40:51.39,the east dims as the west glows.,#A9A0FF
0:40:51.39,0:40:57.03,A day will come where the sun enters the jade treasure,,#A9A0FF
0:40:57.03,0:41:07.15,spreading its mighty name far, sending tremors through the land.,#A9A0FF
0:41:08.26,0:41:11.28,Qi Yan: Ask His Highness to send this poem to the northern nine provinces with haste,,#A9A0FF
0:41:11.71,0:41:13.67,turn it into a catchy tune.,#A9A0FF
0:41:14.58,0:41:16.36,Teach it to the children first,,#A9A0FF
0:41:16.97,0:41:18.83,and let it find its way to the capital city.,#A9A0FF
0:41:20.57,0:41:22.40,Xie An: Worthy brother is truly a schemer like no other!,
0:41:23.20,0:41:24.55,And the message you’d like to give is…?,
0:41:25.52,0:41:28.41,Qi Yan: Please tell the Third Highness…,#A9A0FF
0:41:28.58,0:41:30.89,Xie An: The Third Highness is neither legitimate nor the eldest,,
0:41:31.39,0:41:34.08,and his mother’s family is not as stable as the Second Highness and Fourth Highness either.,
0:41:34.81,0:41:36.12,On the path to snatch the crown…,
0:41:36.33,0:41:37.99,the Third Highness has an innate disadvantage.,
0:41:39.27,0:41:42.07,One who will achieve great things are not bound by minor details!,
0:41:42.48,0:41:43.98,Nangong Wang: Is that all Qi Yan had to say?,
0:41:44.72,0:41:45.22,Nothing else?,
0:41:45.85,0:41:46.45,Xie An: Yes.,
0:41:47.37,0:41:49.39,Other than that insinuating poem,,
0:41:49.78,0:41:51.15,that is all Qi Yan had to say.,
0:41:52.43,0:41:53.92,Nangong Wang: That Qi Yan,,
0:41:54.84,0:41:57.72,he is most certainly qualified to be my top aide,,
0:41:58.85,0:42:01.13,but his schemes and tactics are too sinister.,
0:42:02.26,0:42:05.33,He did not even blink while offering the plan to burn the Weiming palace.,
0:42:06.41,0:42:11.01,His temperament truly makes me uneasy,,
0:42:12.51,0:42:13.49,but…,
0:42:14.55,0:42:19.75,His insight into the greater picture and people’s minds is indispensable aid to me.,
0:42:20.31,0:42:20.88,Xie An: Master,,
0:42:21.68,0:42:23.79,the Second Highness has a skilled person behind him giving him pointers.,
0:42:24.61,0:42:26.22,If you wish to succeed, master,,
0:42:26.58,0:42:28.06,you can’t do it without Qi Yan.,
0:42:29.23,0:42:31.28,Although his tactics are sinister,,
0:42:31.95,0:42:35.12,he only seeks to become an important official.,
0:42:36.10,0:42:38.99,He has no royal blood or a great family background.,
0:42:39.57,0:42:41.31,Once Your Highness ascends to the throne,,
0:42:41.59,0:42:44.93,doesn’t his life and death still depend on your word?,
0:42:45.76,0:42:48.58,Is there truly a need to be so worried, master…?,
0:42:49.87,0:42:51.19,He is a scholar after all,,
0:42:51.38,0:42:52.25,he has nothing but pride in his bones.,
0:42:52.78,0:42:54.21,A little courtesy given,,
0:42:54.60,0:42:55.99,and he will gladly endure any hardships.,
0:42:56.47,0:42:57.12,Nangong Wang: Mn…,
0:42:57.97,0:42:59.03,You are right.,
0:43:00.88,0:43:02.40,Emperor Father has been careful for most of his life.,
0:43:02.74,0:43:04.83,The less unrelated two people may seem,,
0:43:04.83,0:43:05.89,and the less connected two matters may be,,
0:43:06.74,0:43:09.47,as long as one of them is the biggest beneficiary,,
0:43:09.78,0:43:11.93,Emperor Father will certainly catch it…,
0:43:13.93,0:43:16.20,How brilliant of Qi Yan!,
0:43:17.49,0:43:18.31,Xie An!,
0:43:18.96,0:43:19.61,Xie An: This humble one is here.,
0:43:19.77,0:43:20.96,Nangong Wang: Go and prepare…,
0:43:21.87,0:43:23.76,Do as Qi Yan says.,
0:43:24.31,0:43:25.00,Xie An: Understood!,
0:43:56.71,0:44:02.06,Jingnu: You, my first love, my forever,#FF7D40
0:44:02.06,0:44:05.23,the ocean depths, the searing flame,#FF7D40
