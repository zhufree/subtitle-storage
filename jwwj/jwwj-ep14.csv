0:01:13.01,0:01:16.39,Qiuju: This maid boldly asked the gonggong who came to deliver the decree,,
0:01:16.39,0:01:17.50,it seems that…,

0:01:31.68,0:01:33.94,Qiuju: Sijiu must have told the gonggong  who delivered the decree,
0:01:33.94,0:01:36.55,to let this maid know a little more.,
0:01:36.86,0:01:37.77,He said that…,
0:01:38.16,0:01:40.26,His Highness the Eldest Prince might have eaten something,
0:01:40.26,0:01:41.29,that caused him to die instantly.,

0:01:49.58,0:01:50.49,she made a scene before His Majesty,,
0:01:50.68,0:01:52.56,and ultimately charged head-first to her death.,
0:01:53.01,0:01:54.65,His Majesty was quite furious.,
0:01:54.75,0:01:57.15,He has decreed for all of the Princes and Princesses still in the capital,
0:01:57.15,0:01:58.29,to enter the palace.,

0:03:00.50,0:03:02.43,Qi Yan: Although this subject was not told about the reason behind this summoning,,#A9A0FF
0:03:02.89,0:03:04.61,the gonggong did hint that,#A9A0FF
0:03:04.61,0:03:06.18,this subject should dress in plain colors.,#A9A0FF

0:03:21.35,0:03:22.94,**He has attacked his own brother!**,#A9A0FF
0:03:23.49,0:03:24.00,Nangong Jingnu: Mn,,#FF7D40
0:03:24.42,0:03:25.92,I thought it was very sudden too.,#FF7D40
0:03:26.60,0:03:29.89,Big royal brother has always been a taboo topic among the royal family.,#FF7D40
0:03:30.81,0:03:32.14,When Emperor Father ascended,,#FF7D40
0:03:32.22,0:03:34.60,he granted him a residence in the capital’s domain,,#FF7D40
0:03:34.94,0:03:36.26,and he was not allowed to enter the palace without summons.,#FF7D40
0:03:37.37,0:03:39.80,I know some things about him,#FF7D40
0:03:40.17,0:03:41.87,from what my sisters tell me…,#FF7D40
0:03:42.71,0:03:43.63,I’ll tell you,,#FF7D40
0:03:43.95,0:03:45.28,just so you’ll know what you’re getting into.,#FF7D40

0:03:49.64,0:03:51.09,Nangong Jingnu: It’s a story from the previous reign.,#FF7D40
0:03:51.92,0:03:53.47,Emperor Father was still just a minister at the time,,#FF7D40
0:03:54.21,0:03:55.54,and the Eldest Prince’s mother,#FF7D40
0:03:55.81,0:03:57.88,was a servant girl of our estate.,#FF7D40
0:03:58.62,0:03:59.84,Because of some reasons,,#FF7D40
0:03:59.92,0:04:03.65,she hid her pregnancy until the Eldest Prince was born.,#FF7D40
0:04:04.86,0:04:05.78,Apparently,,#FF7D40
0:04:06.03,0:04:08.00,the kingdom-wide mourning period for the Empress Dowager of the previous reign,#FF7D40
0:04:08.00,0:04:08.99,was still ongoing at the time.,#FF7D40
0:04:09.75,0:04:11.46,Empress Mother had to use over half of her dowry,#FF7D40
0:04:11.46,0:04:12.52,on many places,#FF7D40
0:04:12.88,0:04:14.46,to keep this mess from reaching the court.,#FF7D40
0:04:15.49,0:04:17.99,Emperor Father wanted to get rid of the mother and son right away,,#FF7D40
0:04:19.14,0:04:22.49,but they were left alive because of Empress Mother’s kindness…,#FF7D40
0:04:23.24,0:04:26.10,Emperor Father disliked the two of them ever since,,#FF7D40
0:04:26.81,0:04:28.53,but even a wicked tiger would not eat its young.,#FF7D40
0:04:29.26,0:04:31.55,Emperor Father did not make things difficult for them again.,#FF7D40
0:04:32.34,0:04:34.15,The eunuch who delivered the decree earlier said that,#FF7D40
0:04:34.56,0:04:36.23,the Eldest Prince died suddenly.,#FF7D40
0:04:36.64,0:04:37.91,Zhaorong Li went to the Ganquan palace,#FF7D40
0:04:37.91,0:04:39.24,drenched from the rain and made a scene,,#FF7D40
0:04:39.69,0:04:41.40,running head-first to her death soon after.,#FF7D40
0:04:42.43,0:04:43.32,I suppose…,#FF7D40
0:04:44.04,0:04:46.41,Zhaorong Li might have thought that,#FF7D40
0:04:46.65,0:04:48.98,Emperor Father couldn’t let the two of them live any longer,,#FF7D40
0:04:49.58,0:04:50.89,but I believe in Emperor Father.,#FF7D40
0:04:50.89,0:04:52.33,He wouldn’t have done this.,#FF7D40
0:04:53.24,0:04:54.64,Things were so dangerous back then,,#FF7D40
0:04:54.64,0:04:56.33,yet he did not do anything to them,,#FF7D40
0:04:56.33,0:04:58.94,so why would he now?,#FF7D40
0:04:59.76,0:05:02.10,Qi Yan: Mn, you are right, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:05:02.56,0:05:03.98,Nangong Jingnu: Emperor Father has no legitimate son.,#FF7D40
0:05:04.41,0:05:06.79,The Eldest Prince still carries the title of eldest son in the end.,#FF7D40
0:05:07.41,0:05:08.06,His death…,#FF7D40
0:05:08.25,0:05:09.78,won’t be a small matter.,#FF7D40
0:05:10.94,0:05:12.58,Now that second royal brother is away from the capital,,#FF7D40
0:05:12.83,0:05:14.16,everything is off-kilter…,#FF7D40
0:05:14.97,0:05:17.20,Just stay close to me when we enter the palace.,#FF7D40
0:05:17.51,0:05:19.24,Do not say anything more than necessary,,#FF7D40
0:05:19.82,0:05:21.61,and do not greet those royal brothers of mine.,#FF7D40
0:05:22.48,0:05:25.29,We will enter quietly,,#FF7D40
0:05:25.70,0:05:26.81,and leave quietly.,#FF7D40
0:05:27.43,0:05:28.07,Qi Yan: Yes,,#A9A0FF
0:05:28.39,0:05:29.64,this subject will be careful.,#A9A0FF

0:05:37.02,0:05:40.44,**Her analysis and judgement**,#A9A0FF
0:05:40.44,0:05:42.32,**have matured quite a lot.**,#A9A0FF

0:12:09.05,0:12:12.01,I thought your career was over when you became Fuma,,
0:12:12.51,0:12:14.80,but I didn’t think that His Majesty would choose to abolish the old law,

0:13:04.32,0:13:05.83,but a year and a half is most certainly needed.,#A9A0FF
0:13:06.03,0:13:06.61,Gongyang Huai: Ai,,
0:13:07.15,0:13:08.00,you’d be wrong to say that.,

0:13:16.15,0:13:19.21,It’s not like there aren’t outstanding people around our age,,
0:13:19.64,0:13:22.68,so why were you appointed for this position?,
0:13:24.65,0:13:25.36,Qi Yan: That…,#A9A0FF
0:13:26.40,0:13:28.13,did not occur to me.,#A9A0FF

0:13:30.73,0:13:32.10,so there are some things you must know.,
0:13:33.21,0:13:34.70,Back in the time where I just entered the court,,
0:13:35.01,0:13:36.00,the crowning of a prince,
0:13:36.30,0:13:39.57,was already a frequently brought up political issue.,
0:13:40.68,0:13:42.04,His Majesty has nine sons,,
0:13:42.04,0:13:42.89,all born from consorts,,
0:13:43.33,0:13:44.86,and since the eldest son did not have a good background,,
0:13:45.18,0:13:47.48,the position of Crown Prince remained undecided.,
0:13:48.17,0:13:49.33,But things have changed.,
0:13:49.86,0:13:51.10,The Eldest Prince has passed way,,
0:13:51.28,0:13:53.30,so the Second Prince is the next oldest son…,
0:13:54.05,0:13:55.71,The Second Prince is of noble birth,,
0:13:56.05,0:13:57.31,his mother’s family has strong influence,,
0:13:57.82,0:13:58.71,and the Fourth Prince,,
0:13:58.71,0:13:59.62,sharing the same mother,,
0:13:59.62,0:14:00.09,supports him.,
0:14:00.85,0:14:02.82,Although he has made a few careless mistakes the last time he governed the kingdom,,
0:14:03.29,0:14:04.34,I heard that,
0:14:04.34,0:14:06.51,he has gained excellent political achievements in the northern nine provinces.,
0:14:07.66,0:14:08.27,Ai,,
0:14:08.80,0:14:11.45,now the court is split into three parties…,
0:14:11.78,0:14:12.52,the Second and Fourth party,,
0:14:12.79,0:14:13.34,the Third party,,
0:14:13.57,0:14:14.07,and…,
0:14:14.27,0:14:15.05,the neutral party.,
0:14:15.68,0:14:17.45,Qi Yan: The matter of inheritance concerns the future of the kingdom.,#A9A0FF
0:14:17.77,0:14:19.50,Loyalty to the monarch is the duty of a subject.,#A9A0FF
0:14:20.27,0:14:23.36,What does this have to do with my appointment as Vice Minister of Works?,#A9A0FF
0:14:24.24,0:14:25.70,Gongyang Huai: To say something disrespectful,,
0:14:26.09,0:14:27.74,if the Zhenzhen Highness was a man,,
0:14:27.92,0:14:30.75,would His Majesty have to worry so much over the choice of heir?,
0:14:31.50,0:14:33.82,Just ask any sons of nobles in the capital city:,
0:14:34.29,0:14:36.99,how many exceptions and favors have the Zhenzhen Highness received over the years?,
0:14:37.82,0:14:40.28,His Majesty cares so dearly for his only legitimate bloodline,,
0:14:40.48,0:14:42.99,would he not plan ahead for the Zhenzhen Highness’ future?,
0:14:43.99,0:14:44.65,Who do you think,
0:14:44.92,0:14:47.78,His Majesty abolished the old law preventing inner subjects from participating in politics for?,
0:14:48.25,0:14:50.94,Putting the name of that Lu Zhongxing ahead of you,
0:14:51.31,0:14:54.16,is just a way to keep the court officials from complaining.,
0:14:54.70,0:14:56.55,The person who His Majesty truly wanted to promote…,
0:14:56.55,0:14:57.17,is you!,

0:15:09.62,0:15:11.17,Gongyang Huai: Is such words necessary between us?,
0:15:11.77,0:15:13.68,We are both top-scorers in the same exam,,
0:15:14.10,0:15:16.21,and the Gongyang estate is indebted to you for saving us.,
0:15:16.65,0:15:19.43,Of course I will tell you anything I know, sparing no detail.,
0:15:20.08,0:15:20.52,Ai,,

0:15:22.15,0:15:23.92,my career is over now.,
0:15:28.88,0:15:29.34,Ai,,
0:15:30.02,0:15:32.18,do you still remember that big-shot of the Yun province,,

0:15:38.55,0:15:39.83,He has military merit now.,

0:15:43.17,0:15:44.83,he’s managed to get completely ahead of me,,
0:15:45.72,0:15:46.29,argh!,
0:15:46.80,0:15:48.68,After all the years I spent in hard study,,
