0:00:56.62,0:00:57.50,The masked person: What?,
0:00:58.02,0:01:00.42,Wu Da: This lowly one found out that,
0:01:00.42,0:01:03.90,Qi Yan has been selling calligraphy in the capital city under the pen name of the Hermit Shepherd.,
0:01:03.90,0:01:07.17,Scholars have always held merchants in disdain,,
0:01:07.17,0:01:10.67,and any scholar who sells their writing would be criticized.,
0:01:12.07,0:01:15.45,After all the master has done to educate her and send her to the capital,,
0:01:15.45,0:01:17.77,why would she sabotage herself like this?,
0:01:19.85,0:01:22.90,The masked person: After the epidemic that broke out in the Jin province in Jingjia First Year,,
0:01:22.90,0:01:24.80,nine out of ten homes were left empty.,
0:01:24.80,0:01:28.50,How could a Jin province scholar of modest background like Qi Yan,
0:01:28.50,0:01:32.47,have enough funds to support herself in the capital city?,
0:01:32.47,0:01:34.40,Wu Da: She would have funds from the master…,
0:01:38.17,0:01:39.37,This lowly one understands now!,

0:01:42.82,0:01:45.00,no matter how talented Qi Yan may be,,
0:01:45.75,0:01:47.37,he will make sure to investigate,
0:01:47.62,0:01:51.97,everything about her past before putting her in any important position.,
0:01:52.70,0:01:55.32,Qi Yan involving herself with the business of merchants in order to enter the exam,
0:01:55.32,0:01:57.30,will not become a ‘stain’ for her,,
0:01:57.90,0:02:00.45,but a point of assurance for Nangong Rang instead.,
0:02:02.40,0:02:04.45,Wu Da, oh Wu Da,,

0:02:19.07,0:02:23.45,Master… If Qi Yan were to betray the master…,
