0:14:39.37,0:14:41.60,You used to never show any emotion,,
0:14:43.47,0:14:47.15,I was always worried that you’d drive yourself mad.,
0:14:48.75,0:14:51.07,Qi Yan: So what if I’m made Fuma?,#A9A0FF
0:14:52.27,0:14:55.30,The Zhenzhen Princess is old thief Nangong’s most beloved daughter.,#A9A0FF
0:14:55.82,0:14:59.30,I will just take her down with me on the day of the wedding!,#A9A0FF
0:15:01.12,0:15:03.54,Even though this isn’t the result I want,,#A9A0FF
0:15:04.19,0:15:10.05,I have to at least make that culprit experience what it’s like to lose a loved one!,#A9A0FF

0:15:14.85,0:15:17.07,Come over here, let me take a look at you first.,
0:15:18.20,0:15:19.75,The master has a message for you.,
0:15:34.10,0:15:35.35,Ding You: It hasn’t even been that long…,
0:15:35.90,0:15:38.32,How did you manage to ruin your health to this extent?,
0:15:39.47,0:15:41.75,Are you never worried that you might torment yourself to death long,
0:15:41.75,0:15:43.30,before your revenge is complete?,
0:15:44.72,0:15:45.85,Qi Yan: That won’t happen.,#A9A0FF
0:15:46.40,0:15:49.92,I won’t die before all of my enemies have died by my hand.,#A9A0FF
0:15:51.77,0:15:53.93,Ding You: You almost drowned back then,,
0:15:53.93,0:15:58.32,and the master had to use all of her rarest medical ingredients to save your life, just barely.,
0:15:58.72,0:16:01.60,For months after that, you’d have fevers and faint from time to time.,
0:16:01.60,0:16:05.62,The qi of water and fire have been entrenched between your lungs and heart since then.,
0:16:05.95,0:16:07.62,Your body is weak to both high and low temperatures, you…,

0:16:32.25,0:16:35.55,It will relieve your fever, and suppress your dream demons.,
0:16:36.27,0:16:38.05,Take one once every three days.,
0:16:38.90,0:16:39.75,As for the white bottle…,
0:16:40.72,0:16:43.95,There’s only one pill inside, use it with caution.,
0:16:45.57,0:16:48.37,On the day of the wedding, take it early in the day.,
0:16:49.15,0:16:52.35,If the situation doesn’t seem right, drink the wine of unity.,
0:16:52.75,0:16:55.72,That pill will turn into poison once it meets alcohol.,
0:16:56.15,0:16:59.60,It’s toxic enough to make you seriously ill, keeping you in a condition unfit for intercourse for months.,
0:17:01.32,0:17:03.57,According to the rules of the inner court,,
0:17:03.57,0:17:05.85,I am the first imperial doctor to diagnose you,,
0:17:06.57,0:17:11.22,so I’ll be in charge of your check-ups when you become Fuma as well.,
0:17:13.32,0:17:14.35,Qi Yan: Many thanks.,#A9A0FF
0:17:15.10,0:17:17.25,Ding You: Nangong Jingnu is just a Princess.,
0:17:17.67,0:17:21.52,Killing her at the cost of your own life will only hurt Nangong Rang alone,,
0:17:22.07,0:17:24.62,it will do nothing to shake the mountains and rivers of the Wei kingdom.,
0:17:26.55,0:17:27.77,The master also ordered me to tell you that,
0:17:28.67,0:17:30.10,blessing and misfortune depend on one another…,
0:17:30.97,0:17:34.10,making good use of your status as Fuma might not necessarily be a deviation from the plan.,
0:17:35.52,0:17:38.40,Qi Yan: I have done a lot of thinking for the past few days,,#A9A0FF
0:17:38.40,0:17:39.62,and I had that idea as well,,#A9A0FF
0:17:40.95,0:17:42.22,I just…,#A9A0FF
0:17:42.77,0:17:46.25,don’t know how I will keep my identity secret from the daughter of my enemy, who I will soon have to share the same bed.,#A9A0FF
0:17:47.25,0:17:48.85,Once I am exposed to be a woman,,#A9A0FF
0:17:49.55,0:17:52.70,even you will be unable to avoid death by association, being my imperial doctor.,#A9A0FF
0:17:54.25,0:17:57.10,I advise you to pull yourself out of this mess as soon as possible.,#A9A0FF
0:17:58.07,0:18:00.07,If things go wrong on the day of the wedding,,#A9A0FF
0:18:01.02,0:18:04.15,I will make sure that Princess dies with me!,#A9A0FF
0:18:06.57,0:18:10.55,Ding You: I entered the palace three years before you, so I’ve seen that Princess before.,
0:18:11.47,0:18:16.15,She is very sheltered by old thief Nangong, her personality is utterly naïve and simple!,
0:18:16.57,0:18:20.57,Her fourteenth birthday has just passed recently,,
0:18:20.57,0:18:22.72,she’s just an immature girl.,
0:18:23.57,0:18:27.42,As long as you make it through the wedding night, with your mind and tactics,,
0:18:27.55,0:18:29.37,aren’t you perfectly capable of talking your way around her?,
0:18:29.97,0:18:32.70,You can just move to the Fuma estate once it is built,,
0:18:33.10,0:18:37.52,and only visit the Princess estate as required for the major dates and every first and fifteenth of the month.,
0:18:38.72,0:18:39.92,Qi Yan: I’ve got it.,#A9A0FF
0:18:40.62,0:18:43.17,Oh, there’s something…,#A9A0FF
0:18:43.45,0:18:45.00,I need you to tell Shifu for me.,#A9A0FF
0:18:45.40,0:18:46.30,Ding You: Mm.,
0:18:47.20,0:18:48.60,Qi Yan: On the day of the Chionglin banquet,,#A9A0FF
0:18:49.00,0:18:52.62,Commandant Lu Quan suddenly returned from his stay at the hot spring mountains,,#A9A0FF
0:18:53.37,0:18:55.62,intending to request a marriage arrangement for his second son in front of an audience,,#A9A0FF
0:18:56.47,0:19:00.37,but Nangong Rang was shameless enough to make an arrangement before him.,#A9A0FF
0:19:01.65,0:19:03.47,If I’m not mistaken,,#A9A0FF
0:19:04.32,0:19:07.02,I am just a shield that Nangong Rang dragged in,#A9A0FF
0:19:07.02,0:19:09.57,to keep his lawful daughter from marrying into the Commandant estate…,#A9A0FF
0:19:11.52,0:19:13.47,Nangong Rang’s path to the throne was not legitimate,,#A9A0FF
0:19:13.47,0:19:14.90,he entirely depended on the aid of Lu Quan to occupy it.,#A9A0FF
0:19:15.77,0:19:21.27,I’m afraid this marriage arrangement is nothing more than a delaying tactic.,#A9A0FF
0:19:23.97,0:19:26.75,Ding You: I understand, I will deliver this message.,
0:19:29.12,0:19:32.50,I can’t stay here for too long, I’ll come and see you again in a few days.,
0:19:33.15,0:19:34.20,Qi Yan: I won’t be escorting you.,#A9A0FF

0:35:49.64,0:35:51.45,**they’ve already known each other.**,#FF7D40
0:35:51.97,0:35:54.81,**Maybe it’s because I insisted on coming along that day**,#FF7D40
0:35:55.13,0:35:56.86,**that they weren’t able to properly meet each other.**,#FF7D40
0:35:58.49,0:36:02.30,Old maid: And now, Your Highness, Lord Fuma, please drink the wine of unity…,
0:36:02.30,0:36:02.91,Nangong Jingnu: Leave it there.,#FF7D40

0:36:52.98,0:36:54.76,Since this is not ‘mutually-agreed upon’,,#FF7D40
0:36:55.06,0:36:58.08,we’d best ‘stay out of each other’s way’ from now on.,#FF7D40

0:38:10.18,0:38:13.24,I heard that you’re not supposed to drink wine because of an old illness,,#FF7D40
0:38:13.68,0:38:15.66,and we are not husband and wife anyways,,#FF7D40
0:38:16.28,0:38:18.15,so just leave the wine.,#FF7D40
0:38:19.36,0:38:20.11,Qi Yan: Then…,#A9A0FF
0:38:20.66,0:38:21.97,this subject will go to sleep in the side room now?,#A9A0FF

0:38:58.24,0:38:58.82,Nangong Jingnu: …,#FF7D40
0:39:00.08,0:39:01.29,I heard,,#FF7D40
0:39:02.04,0:39:05.54,that the red candle must burn throughout the night of the wedding!,#FF7D40
0:39:06.22,0:39:07.15,And…,#FF7D40
0:39:07.74,0:39:10.08,and besides, didn’t you say that you have an eye condition?,#FF7D40
0:39:11.38,0:39:11.92,Qi Yan: Oh.,#A9A0FF
0:39:13.49,0:39:16.43,Qi Yan: **Clearly, this Princess is just afraid of the dark.**,#A9A0FF
0:39:17.54,0:39:19.79,Qi Yan: Alright, this subject will leave it like this.,#A9A0FF
0:39:20.92,0:39:22.67,Go to sleep, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF

0:39:45.97,0:39:50.29,Qi Yan: **Mercy from the heavens, I didn’t think things would turn out like this.**,#A9A0FF
0:39:51.72,0:39:55.90,**The famed Zhenzhen Princess is even more naïve than I expected.**,#A9A0FF
0:39:58.07,0:40:00.49,**Ding You’s drug is no longer needed as well.**,#A9A0FF
0:40:01.70,0:40:03.66,**This agreement of gentlemen…**,#A9A0FF

0:40:14.07,0:40:15.92,**This person is the Hermit Shepherd,**,#FF7D40
0:40:16.89,0:40:19.76,**and the one who er-jie is actually in love with.**,#FF7D40
0:40:20.90,0:40:25.97,**Perhaps he only chose to meet er-jie that way because he saw that I was there.**,#FF7D40
0:40:27.47,0:40:28.66,**Now that I think about it…**,#FF7D40
0:40:29.21,0:40:33.41,**the Gongyang estate isn’t far, but er-jie has yet to return the folding fan.**,#FF7D40
0:40:36.60,0:40:40.40,**Since this concerns er-jie’s reputation, ai, it’ll be hard to ask about this from now on.**,#FF7D40
0:40:41.91,0:40:45.10,**It’s a good thing that he agreed to the agreement of gentlemen…**,#FF7D40
0:41:01.48,0:41:02.50,Nangong Jingnu: **Well,**,#FF7D40
