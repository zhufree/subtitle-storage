0:13:10.77,0:13:13.75,let’s start from a ‘robbery array’ this time.,#A9A0FF
0:13:14.05,0:13:15.40,Nangong Jingnu: Robbery array?,#FF7D40
0:13:15.60,0:13:16.75,Qi Yan: Please take a look, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:13:19.65,0:13:24.40,Qi Yan: The ‘robbery’ here refers to a situation where black and white players take each other’s stones.,#A9A0FF
0:13:24.87,0:13:27.87,Each stone that is placed has four liberties,,#A9A0FF
0:13:28.32,0:13:31.30,once the opponent occupies all four liberties,,#A9A0FF
0:13:31.57,0:13:36.40,they can capture the stone in the middle, that is robbery.,#A9A0FF
0:13:37.42,0:13:38.42,Qi Yan: Please take a look, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:13:38.95,0:13:42.07,What this subject just placed is a ‘robbery array’.,#A9A0FF
0:13:42.70,0:13:44.07,Please give it a try, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:13:44.55,0:13:47.40,Where should you place the black stone to capture the white stone?,#A9A0FF
0:13:52.92,0:13:53.75,Nangong Jingnu: Is this right?,#FF7D40
0:13:53.75,0:13:54.55,Qi Yan: Mm,,#A9A0FF
0:13:55.20,0:13:56.82,Your Highness is truly extremely intelligent,,#A9A0FF
0:13:56.82,0:13:58.20,grasping concepts with just a bit of guidance.,#A9A0FF
0:13:59.60,0:14:00.60,Nangong Jingnu: Heh, right~,#FF7D40
0:14:04.52,0:14:07.22,Qi Yan: Here is another situation.,#A9A0FF
0:14:07.92,0:14:10.05,When this subject was around Your Highness’ age,,#A9A0FF
0:14:10.05,0:14:12.15,this endgame stumped this subject for a very long time.,#A9A0FF
0:14:14.87,0:14:18.30,Back then, this subject placed a black stone here,,#A9A0FF
0:14:18.67,0:14:20.77,but my Shifu said that it was not a good solution.,#A9A0FF
0:14:21.62,0:14:24.40,Take a look, Your Highness, what might be a better move?,#A9A0FF
0:14:26.95,0:14:28.77,Nangong Jingnu: Mm…,#FF7D40
0:14:29.95,0:14:31.12,Qi Yan: Look here, Your Highness,,#A9A0FF
0:14:32.15,0:14:35.30,the black stones on the left are about to close in,,#A9A0FF
0:14:36.12,0:14:38.77,if Your Highness plays the same move as this subject did,,#A9A0FF
0:14:39.02,0:14:40.67,it would solve the imminent danger from white,,#A9A0FF
0:14:41.07,0:14:43.95,but you would lose initiative over the right side of the board.,#A9A0FF
0:14:45.05,0:14:48.02,But if black were to seize the chance to counter,,#A9A0FF
0:14:48.40,0:14:51.67,the board would be caught in a stalemate once again.,#A9A0FF
0:14:57.60,0:14:58.27,Nangong Jingnu: Is this right?,#FF7D40
0:15:00.90,0:15:02.65,Qi Yan: For the result of this move,,#A9A0FF
0:15:03.02,0:15:06.92,perhaps Your Highness should decide for yourself after improving in chess.,#A9A0FF
0:15:07.92,0:15:09.85,Nangong Jingnu: Hmph, keeping other’s guessing.,#FF7D40
0:15:11.17,0:15:14.40,Qi Yan: Allow this subject to retrieve paper and a brush to copy this board down.,#A9A0FF
0:15:14.75,0:15:17.37,Nangong Jingnu: There’s no need for that, I can remember it.,#FF7D40
0:15:17.80,0:15:19.70,Qi Yan: Your Highness has the ability to remember things with one look,,#A9A0FF
0:15:19.70,0:15:20.67,this subject is impressed.,#A9A0FF
0:15:23.12,0:15:23.95,Nangong Jingnu: Come in.,#FF7D40
0:15:27.80,0:15:29.72,Qiuju: Your Highness, Lord Fuma.,
0:15:29.85,0:15:30.85,Nangong Jingnu: What is it?,#FF7D40
0:15:31.20,0:15:33.92,Qiuju: Your Highness, the bride’s homecoming is tomorrow.,
0:15:33.92,0:15:35.25,You will need to enter the palace early,,
0:15:35.70,0:15:38.60,perhaps Your Highness and Lord Fuma should sleep early tonight?,
0:15:39.47,0:15:41.62,Nangong Jingnu: Oh, alright.,#FF7D40
0:15:44.02,0:15:50.60,Qi Yan: Your Highness, this subject is just a few pages away from finishing a book, so…,#A9A0FF
0:15:51.40,0:15:52.72,Nangong Jingnu: You can go.,#FF7D40
0:15:53.22,0:15:54.60,Qi Yan: Thank you, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:15:54.60,0:15:55.60,This subject will be leaving now.,#A9A0FF
0:16:05.52,0:16:11.87,[Inside a horse carriage],
0:16:21.77,0:16:24.07,Qi Yan: Perhaps a short rest will be good, Your Highness?,#A9A0FF
0:16:27.82,0:16:30.30,Nangong Jingnu: I waited for you until midnight yesterday night,,#FF7D40
0:16:30.75,0:16:33.87,and then Qiuju woke me up before the sun came up.,#FF7D40
0:16:35.95,0:16:40.15,Qi Yan: This subject… This subject’s vision is impaired at night.,#A9A0FF
0:16:40.60,0:16:42.40,Even though there is sufficient candlelight in the study,,#A9A0FF
0:16:42.40,0:16:44.02,it takes this subject a while to read.,#A9A0FF
0:16:44.67,0:16:46.07,Please forgive this subject, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:16:47.15,0:16:48.80,Nangong Jingnu: Am I very scary?,#FF7D40
0:16:49.17,0:16:51.28,You don’t have to be so careful around me,,#FF7D40
0:16:52.73,0:16:55.37,didn’t we say that we’d be friends?,#FF7D40
0:16:56.42,0:16:57.37,Qi Yan: Yes.,#A9A0FF
0:16:58.40,0:16:59.70,This subject wonders, Your Highness waited for this subject,,#A9A0FF
0:16:59.70,0:17:01.15,was it to tell this subject something?,#A9A0FF
0:17:01.15,0:17:05.42,Nangong Jingnu: Mm. I wanted to tell you about some of the rules and taboos of the palace,,#FF7D40
0:17:05.87,0:17:08.80,since you’re so scared of dying. You wouldn’t want to commit misconduct by accident.,#FF7D40
0:17:10.45,0:17:11.97,Qi Yan: This subject is listening with all ears.,#A9A0FF
0:17:13.56,0:17:16.00,Nangong Jingnu: Emperor Father has eight sons and three daughters…,#FF7D40
0:17:16.00,0:17:18.50,Oh, no, it’s nine sons and three daughters.,#FF7D40
0:17:19.40,0:17:22.30,But even I have never seen the Eldest Prince more than a couple of times.,#FF7D40
0:17:22.93,0:17:25.96,You just have to not mention him, it’s fine if you don’t know about him.,#FF7D40
0:17:26.82,0:17:29.17,Emperor Father still has not officiated another Empress,,#FF7D40
0:17:29.17,0:17:31.47,it is Her Lady the Highest Consort Hui who is in charge of the phoenix seal.,#FF7D40
0:17:31.97,0:17:34.32,She is er-ge and si-ge’s consort mother.,#FF7D40
0:17:35.35,0:17:38.10,San-ge… is much older than us.,#FF7D40
0:17:38.10,0:17:39.32,We’re not very close.,#FF7D40
0:17:40.07,0:17:44.50,Wu-ge is born handicapped, he needs a crutch to walk,,#FF7D40
0:17:45.03,0:17:47.51,but he’s a generous and gentle older brother.,#FF7D40
0:17:47.51,0:17:49.17,Er-jie and I like him the most.,#FF7D40
0:17:51.36,0:17:52.97,It’s hard for him to get around,,#FF7D40
0:17:52.97,0:17:56.25,so I don’t know if he will attend the palace banquet tonight…,#FF7D40
0:17:57.02,0:18:01.07,You have to remember this, don’t look on curiously when you see wu-ge,,#FF7D40
0:18:01.35,0:18:03.25,that would be hurtful to him.,#FF7D40
0:18:03.57,0:18:05.65,Qi Yan: Mm, this subject will remember.,#A9A0FF
0:18:05.95,0:18:10.37,Nangong Jingnu: Old seven is a poor child, his consort mother passed away early,,#FF7D40
0:18:10.37,0:18:12.45,so he has been living under the care of another consort.,#FF7D40
0:18:12.67,0:18:15.02,He is withdrawn in nature and rarely speaks,,#FF7D40
0:18:15.50,0:18:18.82,so he probably won’t attend the homecoming banquet tonight either.,#FF7D40
0:18:19.40,0:18:21.40,Old eight and old nine are still children.,#FF7D40
0:18:21.72,0:18:23.73,Old eight shares the same mother as my oldest sister,,#FF7D40
0:18:23.73,0:18:26.03,the Chionghua Princess, who is already married,,#FF7D40
0:18:26.36,0:18:28.71,but their ages are truly too far apart.,#FF7D40
0:18:29.17,0:18:32.05,I was still a child when da-jie married and moved away.,#FF7D40
0:18:33.25,0:18:37.04,As for er-jie, you… you know.,#FF7D40
0:18:37.94,0:18:42.32,Qi Yan: Oh. Huh, there seems to be someone missing.,#A9A0FF
0:18:42.86,0:18:43.95,What about the Sixth Highness?,#A9A0FF
0:18:44.56,0:18:48.18,Nangong Jingnu: Oh, him… He’s the son of Her Lady Consort Liang.,#FF7D40
0:18:48.41,0:18:49.47,We don’t get along.,#FF7D40
0:18:50.19,0:18:52.52,Qi Yan: Mm, this subject understands.,#A9A0FF
0:18:53.40,0:18:54.81,This subject will stay far away from the Sixth Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:18:55.92,0:18:56.90,Nangong Jingnu: Why?,#FF7D40
0:18:57.47,0:18:58.75,Qi Yan: Your Highness is most magnanimous.,#A9A0FF
0:18:59.20,0:19:01.07,If the Sixth Highness doesn’t get along with Your Highness,,#A9A0FF
0:19:01.42,0:19:02.78,he is unlikely to be a good person,,#A9A0FF
0:19:03.66,0:19:05.99,of course this subject has to stay away.,#A9A0FF
0:19:08.45,0:19:11.25,Nangong Jingnu: Looks like it isn’t so bad to be timid and fearful of death,,#FF7D40
0:19:11.73,0:19:13.58,you’d know better to avoid danger than most people.,#FF7D40
0:19:15.58,0:19:18.70,We’re about to reach the palace gates, we’ll have to switch to a sedan later.,#FF7D40

0:26:10.04,0:26:12.93,When you are free, there is no harm in taking her outside for walks together.,
0:26:13.54,0:26:17.33,She loves the novelties in the common streets, you should know that.,
