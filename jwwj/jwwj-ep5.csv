0:00:52.30,0:00:55.22,Considering how dearly that old thief Nangong treats his legitimate daughter,,
0:00:55.22,0:00:56.27,this arrangement should be implausible.,

0:01:27.20,0:01:30.15,the Commandant estate must have had designs on Nangong Jingnu,,
0:01:30.32,0:01:35.25,and old thief Nangong is also planning to make a move against the Commandant estate.,

0:15:32.20,0:15:33.95,Qi Yan: Isn’t that the best option?,#A9A0FF
0:15:35.10,0:15:36.85,Considering Nangong Wang’s conditions,,#A9A0FF
0:15:37.12,0:15:43.15,if he wants to ascend to the throne, he won’t be able avoid getting his hands dirty eliminating dissidents.,#A9A0FF
0:15:44.05,0:15:46.25,To watch the Nangong imperial clan turn against themselves,,#A9A0FF
0:15:46.25,0:15:51.31,a father killing his son, a son killing his father, brothers killing each other…,#A9A0FF

0:22:31.37,0:22:34.02,but that is unrelated to this cold.,
0:22:35.57,0:22:37.77,Fortunately, Lord Fuma is still young,,
0:22:38.17,0:22:41.52,attentive care and sufficient rest should repair Lord Fuma’s health in a few years.,
0:22:42.92,0:22:46.65,The cold is almost over, so it’s fine to stop taking simmered medicine.,
0:22:47.52,0:22:51.12,Taking medical meals for the next three to five days should bring Lord Fuma to full recovery.,
