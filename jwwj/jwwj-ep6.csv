0:05:13.15,0:05:14.27,during the scheduled pulse reading tomorrow instead.,#A9A0FF

0:06:24.32,0:06:27.20,Otherwise, you wouldn’t have come to my palace to ask for pastries to eat.,#FF7D40
0:06:30.15,0:06:31.00,Rest assured,,#FF7D40
0:06:31.52,0:06:33.62,since we have made an agreement of gentlemen,,#FF7D40

0:07:23.45,0:07:25.70,and Your Highness said that Second Highness is proficient in music,,#A9A0FF
0:07:26.57,0:07:28.00,this subject thought that…,#A9A0FF
0:07:28.37,0:07:31.62,perhaps music could help to loosen the knot in the Second Highness heart.,#A9A0FF
0:07:32.65,0:07:35.50,As long as the emotions suppressed within can be vented out,,#A9A0FF
0:07:35.90,0:07:37.35,she’d be halfway through recovery.,#A9A0FF

0:07:41.02,0:07:42.95,Qi Yan: Unlike spoken language,,#A9A0FF
0:07:43.35,0:07:45.67,emotions are easier to express through music,,#A9A0FF
0:07:46.20,0:07:49.20,and less accountable.,#A9A0FF

0:08:06.82,0:08:07.82,Nangong Jingnu: What about you?,#FF7D40
0:08:08.90,0:08:12.17,Do you have things that you can’t say, and will that can’t be expressed?,#FF7D40
