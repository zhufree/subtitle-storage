0:26:58.37,0:27:01.57,he will not be able to ensure that Her Highness has a lifetime of well-being.,#A9A0FF
0:27:02.25,0:27:06.17,As they say, a change of sovereign brings a change of ministers.,#A9A0FF
0:27:06.82,0:27:10.87,Before a new monarch succeeds the position, nothing is set in stone.,#A9A0FF
0:27:11.90,0:27:17.52,On this, the Third Highness and I share the same predicament.,#A9A0FF
0:27:19.70,0:27:20.62,Nangong Wang: Go on.,
0:27:22.00,0:27:25.25,Qi Yan: The reasoning behind choosing Your Highness, is not a blind leap of faith,,#A9A0FF
0:27:25.75,0:27:28.67,but a thought-out decision made after careful observation.,#A9A0FF
0:27:30.12,0:27:32.67,When observing His Majesty’s many Princes,,#A9A0FF
0:27:33.12,0:27:35.15,only the Third Highness is the most outstanding.,#A9A0FF
0:27:36.00,0:27:38.82,Yet, Your Highness is neither legitimate nor the eldest.,#A9A0FF
0:27:39.17,0:27:41.20,Without a justifiable reason, the path to success is impeded.,#A9A0FF
0:27:43.20,0:27:46.65,This subject is willing to exert all possible effort for Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:27:47.17,0:27:51.05,This subject only requests that it is not forgotten in the future.,#A9A0FF
0:27:54.55,0:27:57.17,Nangong Wang: You’re just so sure that I will make use of you?,
0:27:57.80,0:28:01.80,That I won’t have you tied up and handed to Emperor Father?,
0:28:03.10,0:28:07.62,Qi Yan: A monstrous schemer can only truly shine with a king of great talent and bold vision.,#A9A0FF
0:28:08.35,0:28:10.65,If the Third Highness has no such intent,,#A9A0FF
0:28:11.42,0:28:16.32,why did you acquaint yourself with me when I was just a scholar of modest background at the city’s outskirts?,#A9A0FF
0:28:17.20,0:28:18.17,Nangong Wang: Well said!,
0:28:19.32,0:28:23.90,Right now, I do have a troubling matter that I hope you can advise on, brother-in-law.,
0:28:24.55,0:28:25.92,Qi Yan: Please go ahead, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:28:28.62,0:28:32.42,Nangong Wang: Although Emperor Father is in his prime, he is now fifty-one.,
0:28:32.95,0:28:34.72,Yet no Prince has been crowned.,
0:28:35.20,0:28:40.12,Those old officials have been pressing Emperor Father to crown a Prince for ‘the sake of the kingdom’ …,
0:28:40.77,0:28:42.25,You probably don’t know this yet,,
0:28:42.70,0:28:45.62,but Emperor Father has already decreed for old two to govern the kingdom during Qingming.,
0:28:46.82,0:28:49.57,Throughout history, only Crown Princes were given the authority to govern the kingdom.,
0:28:50.30,0:28:51.60,If this is carried out successfully,,
0:28:52.15,0:28:54.45,even if Emperor Father doesn’t crown a Prince for now,,
0:28:54.82,0:28:59.30,it will still give the court officials and common folks the idea that it’s a trial run.,
0:29:00.95,0:29:04.62,Tell me, what should I do?,
0:29:05.52,0:29:08.42,Qi Yan: The imperial decree has been given, it cannot be undone.,#A9A0FF
0:29:09.02,0:29:14.45,The only plan for now is to let the Second Prince make careless mistakes while governing the kingdom,,#A9A0FF
0:29:14.77,0:29:18.50,or simply to create some artificial problems.,#A9A0FF
0:29:19.07,0:29:23.72,Let His Majesty see that the Second Prince is not capable enough to shoulder great responsibility,,#A9A0FF
0:29:24.27,0:29:25.47,that is the best plan.,#A9A0FF
0:29:27.82,0:29:29.22,Nangong Wang: Hah, wouldn’t I know that?,
0:29:30.30,0:29:32.57,But old two has always been cautious and meticulous.,
0:29:32.87,0:29:35.95,Now that he finally has this chance, he will only be more careful.,
0:29:36.45,0:29:41.25,I am third in line while Nangong Ping’s birth is too low to inherit the throne.,
0:29:41.72,0:29:43.90,Old two and old four are brothers of the same parents.,
0:29:43.90,0:29:48.45,If anything happens to old two, Emperor Father will definitely suspect me.,
0:29:49.75,0:29:51.70,Doesn’t this make it pointless to depose old two?,
0:29:52.75,0:29:54.77,Wouldn’t it just make things easier for others?,
0:29:56.45,0:29:58.30,Qi Yan: What if it was a natural disaster?,#A9A0FF
0:29:59.15,0:30:01.75,Nangong Wang: I don’t have the ability to command nature.,
0:30:02.37,0:30:04.05,Qi Yan: Not exactly, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:30:04.67,0:30:09.42,Based on what the Zhenzhen Highness describes, His Majesty is deeply superstitious.,#A9A0FF
0:30:10.27,0:30:12.80,We simply need to create some ominous signs,,#A9A0FF
0:30:13.17,0:30:17.05,and His Majesty will naturally connect it to the Second Prince.,#A9A0FF
0:30:19.32,0:30:20.52,Nangong Wang: Continue.,
0:30:21.62,0:30:24.85,Qi Yan: Your Highness, you only need to find some loyal subordinates who are willing to die for the cause,,#A9A0FF
0:30:24.85,0:30:26.47,and who have family of their own.,#A9A0FF
0:30:26.47,0:30:29.72,Grant them great rewards and have their family members ‘protected’.,#A9A0FF
0:30:30.62,0:30:34.38,Before the mission, feed them slow-acting poison,#A9A0FF
0:30:34.96,0:30:37.35,and have them hide separately in the inner courtyard of the imperial palace,#A9A0FF
0:30:37.35,0:30:38.77,and the ancestral tomb at the Yong province.,#A9A0FF
0:30:39.35,0:30:42.55,Arrange a specific hour to start fires at the same time…,#A9A0FF
0:30:43.95,0:30:49.07,By then, when fires break out simultaneously in the inner courtyard of the imperial palace and the ancestral tomb,,#A9A0FF
0:30:49.82,0:30:51.55,what will His Majesty think?,#A9A0FF
0:30:53.25,0:30:56.12,Nangong Wang: Emperor Father will surely think that it is an omen from the heavens,,
0:30:56.12,0:30:59.00,that the ancestors are saying old two is not a good choice for the Crown Prince!,
0:31:00.32,0:31:01.35,Qi Yan: That’s right.,#A9A0FF
0:31:01.95,0:31:06.35,His Majesty will surely choose to keep such a sinister matter from public knowledge,,#A9A0FF
0:31:06.35,0:31:08.00,even to the point of covering it up entirely.,#A9A0FF
0:31:08.30,0:31:10.90,Hence there will definitely not be a large-scale investigation,,#A9A0FF
0:31:11.72,0:31:16.05,but we will have successfully stripped the Second Prince’s right to inherit entirely.,#A9A0FF
0:31:16.42,0:31:17.35,Nangong Wang: Excellent!,
0:31:17.77,0:31:19.95,Brother-in-law is a genius indeed.,
0:31:19.95,0:31:21.32,I will return to my estate to arrange this right away.,
0:31:21.32,0:31:23.42,Qi Yan: Just a moment, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:31:24.37,0:31:27.92,This subject has a few more suggestions regarding this matter.,#A9A0FF
0:31:28.67,0:31:29.65,Nangong Wang: Please go ahead, brother-in-law.,
0:31:30.37,0:31:34.97,Qi Yan: This subject suggests burning the Weiming palace.,#A9A0FF
0:32:02.45,0:32:08.52,[Princess estate, Qi Yan’s bedroom],
0:32:09.52,0:32:10.55,Nangong Jingnu: Qi Yan,,#FF7D40
0:32:13.27,0:32:14.97,Qi Yan, I’m back!,#FF7D40
0:32:15.82,0:32:16.92,Qi Yan: Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:32:16.92,0:32:18.17,Nangong Jingnu: Are you reading?,#FF7D40
0:32:19.30,0:32:21.95,I heard from Qiuju that you didn’t even have dinner.,#FF7D40
0:32:22.45,0:32:24.30,Guess what I brought for you?,#FF7D40
0:32:25.82,0:32:26.75,Qi Yan: This subject…,#A9A0FF
0:32:27.02,0:32:28.15,has no idea.,#A9A0FF
0:32:28.15,0:32:29.47,[Nangong Jingnu brings out a food box she hid behind her back],
0:32:29.47,0:32:30.45,Nangong Jingnu: Here!,#FF7D40
0:32:30.45,0:32:34.40,Roasted lamb from the palace, I can see you liked it a lot during the last palace banquet…,#FF7D40
0:32:35.67,0:32:36.55,Qi Yan: Oh…,#A9A0FF
0:32:37.80,0:32:40.60,Nangong Jingnu: This dish was served during the meal just now,,#FF7D40
0:32:40.60,0:32:43.60,so I told the cook to set aside a plate of the tenderest slices and brought it back for you.,#FF7D40
0:32:43.60,0:32:45.15,[Memory],
0:32:45.15,0:32:48.75,Qi Yan: This subject suggests burning the Weiming palace!,#A9A0FF
0:32:49.37,0:32:50.60,Nangong Wang: For what reason?,
0:32:52.55,0:32:58.65,Qi Yan: Of course, burning His Majesty’s Ganquan palace will have far greater impact than the Weiyang Palace.,#A9A0FF
0:32:59.60,0:33:01.40,But do not forget, Your Highness.,#A9A0FF
0:33:01.87,0:33:06.30,Even if His Majesty is not in the palace, the Ganquan palace still houses the Emperor’s jade seal.,#A9A0FF
0:33:06.67,0:33:10.02,It will definitely be highly guarded and difficult to infiltrate.,#A9A0FF
0:33:11.35,0:33:13.57,But things are different for the Weiming palace.,#A9A0FF
0:33:14.02,0:33:16.32,When the Zhenzhen Highness moved from palace to estate,,#A9A0FF
0:33:16.32,0:33:17.92,she had two thousand estate soldiers,,#A9A0FF
0:33:18.75,0:33:22.65,and part of them are guards transferred from the Weiming palace.,#A9A0FF
0:33:24.02,0:33:30.32,Eighty-percent of the guards presently remaining at the Weiming palace were transferred over after that.,#A9A0FF
0:33:30.92,0:33:35.35,They are not very familiar with the location, so it will be easier to sneak past them,,#A9A0FF
0:33:35.87,0:33:38.35,and more convenient for the infiltrators to escape as well…,#A9A0FF
0:33:39.95,0:33:46.07,Qi Yan: Most importantly, the Weiming palace was modified from the East palace of the Crown Prince of the previous reign.,#A9A0FF
0:33:46.07,0:33:48.57,Fire at the Ganquan palace might be a highly ominous sign,,#A9A0FF
0:33:48.57,0:33:50.45,but it does not point clearly at anyone.,#A9A0FF
0:33:51.60,0:33:55.67,Additionally, considering how much His Majesty cares for the Zhenzhen Highness,,#A9A0FF
0:33:56.15,0:33:59.10,he will not let this matter go easily.,#A9A0FF
0:34:01.55,0:34:03.36,Nangong Wang: With the assistance of brother-in-law,,
0:34:03.36,0:34:05.12,what is there left for me to worry about?,
0:34:06.11,0:34:08.21,Since brother-in-law could take this loss of property for my sake,,
0:34:08.51,0:34:11.35,I will compensate you well.,
