0:12:55.60,0:12:57.37,Nangong Jingnu: **Looks like Qi Yan wasn’t lying.**,#FF7D40
0:12:57.75,0:13:00.62,**If he really was the Hermit Shepherd that er-jie was thinking of,**,#FF7D40
0:13:00.95,0:13:03.82,**they wouldn’t be able to interact so harmoniously.**,#FF7D40
0:13:04.55,0:13:05.42,Qi Yan: Please.,#A9A0FF

0:13:35.17,0:13:36.27,**I didn’t think that…**,#FF7D40
0:13:36.70,0:13:39.77,**Qi Yan could actually press er-jie to this degree.**,#FF7D40

0:13:48.05,0:13:50.42,**but judging from er-jie’s expression…**,#FF7D40
0:13:50.55,0:13:52.67,**She seems to be at a disadvantage.**,#FF7D40
0:13:53.67,0:13:56.40,**I know that Qi Yan has always been easy on me,**,#FF7D40
0:13:56.67,0:14:00.07,**but I didn’t expect that he’s actually this advanced in chess.**,#FF7D40
