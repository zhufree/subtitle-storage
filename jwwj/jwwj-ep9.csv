0:25:04.69,0:25:06.27,how could they possibly have caught up?,#FF7D40

0:27:13.88,0:27:14.99,Your injury is on your back,,
0:27:15.33,0:27:17.84,what if old thief Nangong decided to stay and watch?,

0:27:22.34,0:27:25.14,If they saw it, you’re beyond dead!,
0:27:29.64,0:27:33.41,Qi Yan: I’m not that important to warrant a personal visit from Nangong Rang.,#A9A0FF
0:27:34.77,0:27:36.11,Since Nangong Jingnu is fine,,#A9A0FF
0:27:36.40,0:27:37.82,he naturally wouldn’t stay for long.,#A9A0FF
0:27:38.64,0:27:39.57,And besides…,#A9A0FF
0:27:40.60,0:27:41.82,if I was awake,,#A9A0FF
0:27:42.19,0:27:44.77,I won’t be able to avoid a barrage of questions from old thief Nangong.,#A9A0FF
0:27:45.62,0:27:48.92,Nangong Jingnu’s yuhuacong has been tampered with,,#A9A0FF
0:27:49.48,0:27:53.90,but the person who escalated the situation to the point of danger was the Sixth Prince Nangong Lie.,#A9A0FF
0:27:55.49,0:27:57.64,So many pairs of eyes were watching at that time,,#A9A0FF
0:27:58.48,0:28:02.73,old thief Nangong will learn this if he just asked around.,#A9A0FF
0:28:03.21,0:28:04.50,What do you want me to say?,#A9A0FF
0:28:06.25,0:28:08.92,Hiding information would be deception to the Emperor,,#A9A0FF
0:28:09.42,0:28:13.22,but speaking the truth would offend that troublesome Nangong Lie,,#A9A0FF
0:28:15.06,0:28:16.52,so I might as well pretend to be unconscious.,#A9A0FF
0:28:16.99,0:28:19.01,Ding You: You sure are calculating.,
0:28:21.66,0:28:26.83,Aiya, and that poor Zhenzhen Princess was weeping so much for you…,

0:28:36.96,0:28:39.97,But I have to ask… why did you endanger yourself to save her?,
0:28:40.92,0:28:43.22,Since Nangong Lie is there to take the blame for this,,
0:28:43.22,0:28:45.36,why didn’t you use this chance to get rid of Nangong Jingnu,
0:28:45.36,0:28:47.61,and eliminate the potential threat of exposure?,
0:28:48.01,0:28:51.04,You might even be able to break free from the status of Fuma!,
0:28:51.50,0:28:53.28,Qi Yan: If Nangong Jingnu died,,#A9A0FF
0:28:53.81,0:28:56.03,do you think Nangong Rang will let me live?,#A9A0FF
0:28:57.52,0:28:58.89,Although I can’t participate in politics,,#A9A0FF
0:28:59.42,0:29:00.73,the status of Fuma,#A9A0FF
0:29:01.14,0:29:03.49,does give me certain conveniences that court officials do not have.,#A9A0FF
0:29:04.93,0:29:06.50,Qi Yan: Speaking of calculating,,#A9A0FF
0:29:08.12,0:29:08.71,hum…,#A9A0FF
0:29:09.97,0:29:13.22,Ding You, leave a bottle of medicinal alcohol for me.,#A9A0FF
0:29:14.16,0:29:14.72,Ding You: You…,
0:29:16.87,0:29:18.82,You want Nangong Jingnu to apply medicine on you?,
0:29:19.24,0:29:19.92,Are you crazy?,
0:29:20.81,0:29:23.35,Qi Yan: Don’t worry, the wound is on my back.,#A9A0FF
0:29:24.35,0:29:26.62,Even though she appears to be someone who fears nothing from the heavens to the earth,,#A9A0FF
0:29:27.12,0:29:28.71,she is actually very courteous.,#A9A0FF
0:29:29.36,0:29:31.06,She won’t look at anything that she shouldn’t.,#A9A0FF
0:29:34.63,0:29:35.45,You’re right,,#A9A0FF
0:29:36.51,0:29:38.89,the identity of a female Fuma will always be a problem,,#A9A0FF
0:29:40.19,0:29:42.90,so I need someone to be a witness for my identity.,#A9A0FF
0:29:43.43,0:29:45.08,Ding You: This is too risky!,
0:29:45.96,0:29:47.36,Even though you’ve taken drugs,,
0:29:47.49,0:29:50.51,there are still differences between the bone structures of men and women, you…,
0:29:50.51,0:29:53.93,Qi Yan: Does any of my goals not require walking on the knife’s edge?,#A9A0FF
0:29:55.49,0:29:57.04,I am well aware of what I’m doing.,#A9A0FF
0:29:58.10,0:30:00.17,Put the medicine down, and let her in.,#A9A0FF
