6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,554
Jingnv: You, are the initial intention, the eternity

7
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:30,728
the deep sea, the raging fire

8
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:35,140
the devotion, the illusion

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,408
Me, I wavered in thought, made mistakes

10
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:43,500
quenched my thirst, fell into the devil's grasp

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,120
planted the seed, tasted the fruit

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,226
Qi Yan: You, in the temple hall, by the pillow

13
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:59,625
at the crossroads, in my heart

14
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,800
before my eyes, on the horizon

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,853
Me, difficult to break free, difficult to linger

16
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:12,339
difficult to hate, difficult to forgive

17
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:17,260
difficult to choose, difficult to have it all

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,830
Heart, already shattered long ago

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,690
Vanishing into ashes

20
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:31,080
Since entering the dead end, it's hard to regret after hundreds turns

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,580
Jingnv: Love, falling into a tear

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,430
I don't blame anyone

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:43,860
But myself, for giving my true love to the wrong person in the end

24
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,925
Qi Yan: Path, without looking forward, without looking back

25
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:05,225
without hesitation, without turning back

26
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:09,470
without calculating, without letting go

27
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:23,870
Jingnv: Sigh, a battle, a pain, a love, a dream, a play, a void

28
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,510
Together: Heart, already shattered long ago

29
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,370
Vanishing into ashes

30
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,710
Since entering the dead end, it's hard to regret after hundreds turns

31
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,260
Love, falling into a tear

32
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,210
I don't blame anyone

33
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:49,200
But myself, for giving my true love to the wrong person in the end

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,240
Qi Yan: Heart, already shattered long ago

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,830
Vanishing into ashes

36
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:02,310
Since entering the dead end, it's hard to regret after hundreds turns

37
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,740
Jingnv: Love, falling into a tear

38
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,700
I don't blame anyone

39
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,020
But myself, for giving my true love to the wrong person in the end

40
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,930
Together: Heart (heart), already shattered long ago

41
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,620
Vanishing into ashes

42
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,830
Since entering the dead end, it's hard to regret after hundreds turns

43
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,560
Love (love), Love, falling into a tear

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,170
I don't blame anyone

45
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,810
But myself, for giving my true love to the wrong person in the end

46
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:51,035
Jingnv: In the next life, let's continue our predestined relationship and return to each other
