1
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:15,518
(Ancient China, Ming Dynasty)

2
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,304
(Xuanhua pavilion)

3
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:18,750
Shi Qingyi: (opens the door)

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,830
Luo Shen, my new invention is ready.

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,400
Come over and take a look.

6
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,634
Shi Qingyi: Luo Shen?

7
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:30,493
Shi Qingyi: Hmm?

8
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:35,397
She is not in the house, where did she go?

9
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:40,595
(Shi Qingyi opens the door and goes out)

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,235
(Stream gurgling)

11
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:52,490
(Shi Qingyi arrive at the peach blossom tree)

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,529
(Luo Shen is sitting under the tree with her eyes closed.)

13
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:56,860
Shi Qingyi: How much wine has she drunk?

14
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,714
She just went and fell asleep under this tree.

15
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:01,296
Honestly.

16
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:10,195
Shi Qingyi: she didn't even put any clothes on

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,250
isn't she afraid of catching a cold?

18
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,420
she always makes me worry about her.

19
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,660
(Shi Qingyi covers Luo Shen with a robe.)

20
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:21,250
Luo Shen: (waking up and languidly and tipsily) Hmm?

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,525
Qingyi?

22
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:28,120
Shi Qingyi: (Gentle chiding) Is this wine so intoxicating?

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,925
How could you fall asleep here?

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,100
Luo Shen: The new wine you brewed for me

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,900
is quite delicious

26
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,950
I can't help drinking a little more

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,428
Shi Qingyi: You are so fond of wine

28
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,275
It's windy today

29
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:47,885
What if you catch a cold?

30
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:49,839
Hurry go back to your room if you want to sleep.

31
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,648
Luo Shen: What wind?

32
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,954
Why didn't I feel it?

33
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:01,165
I think it's very warm.

34
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,709
Shi Qingyi: It's warm? Are you drunk?

35
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:10,320
The peach blossoms have been scattered everywhere by the wind'.

36
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,519
Look at all the peach blossom petals on you.

37
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:15,489
And you still managed to sleep so soundly.

38
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,116
If you had gone to sleep,

39
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:18,964
 I think you would have been drowned by the flowers.

40
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:22,257
Then I would have to dig you out of this petal pile.

41
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:25,219
Luo Shen: Didn't you just cover me with your robe?

42
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:29,192
Qingyi's robe can protect me

43
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,734
from even the strongest winds

44
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:33,690
Of course I can stay warm.

45
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,150
Shi Qingyi: You are the best at talking nonsense.

46
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:38,805
Shi Qingyi: (pouncing on Luo Shen) Give me back my robe.

47
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,095
Luo Shen: What for?

48
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,570
I was just warming up.

49
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,462
And now you want to take back the robe you covered me with?

50
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:48,243
Shi Qingyi: While the wind is strong.

51
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:49,844
I want to use this robe to catch some of the peach blossom petals 

52
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:51,220
that have fallen and bring them back

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,240
(Luo Shen draws Shi Qingyi into her arms)

54
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,572
Shi Qingyi: Umm, you …… don't hold me so tight.

55
00:02:57,572 --> 00:02:59,959
I won't be able to the peach blossoms.

56
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:08,864
Luo Shen: Well, Qingyi, you already smell good.

57
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:13,067
You don't need to bathe with these peach blossom petals.

58
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,535
Shi Qingyi: Who …… Who said I wanted to take a flower petal bath.

59
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:17,552
I'm just taking these to make wine.

60
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:21,564
Shi Qingyi:( lying on the top of Luo Shen and wriggling around) Let me collect these peach petals on you.

61
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:24,414
Don't move, don't let them fall on the ground.

62
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,874
Luo Shen: (indulgently) All right, I won't move.

63
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:34,410
(Shi Qingyi looks Luo Shen up and down.)

64
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,642
Luo Shen: You're collecting the petals on my body, aren't you?

65
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:42,118
Why are you looking at me like that again?

66
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:45,812
Shi Qingyi: You are pretty, that's why I'm looking at you.

67
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:49,913
Luo Shen: (light laugh) Such sweet words.

68
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,975
Shi Qingyi: Not as sweet as you, you old demon.

69
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:57,614
The words you said to me last night ……

70
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:59,068
Weren't they sweet enough?

71
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,478
I surrender.

72
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:06,151
Luo Shen: If I am an old demon, then what are you?

73
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,294
Shi Qingyi: I've been the wife of an old demon for so many years.

74
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,279
I suppose I just about count as an old demon as well.

75
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:22,513
Luo Shen: How many years have we been married?

76
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,538
Have you counted?

77
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:28,387
Shi Qingyi: From the Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty.

78
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,127
That's a long, long time.

79
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:35,651
I don't want to count the years

80
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:37,229
That's too boring.

81
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:39,969
I've counted.

82
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:42,738
Shifu Qingyi: Why did you do that?

83
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:47,407
Luo Shen: I want to remember

84
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,112
all the time I've spent with you.

85
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,271
Every year, every day.

86
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:57,421
I don't want to forget a single monent.

87
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:01,546
Shi Qingyi:I don't want to forget either.

88
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:04,804
Luo Shen: Qingyi.

89
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:08,475
No matter how much the outside world changes

90
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:11,000
no matter how times change.

91
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:15,762
I will never, ever part with you.

92
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,177
Neither will I.

93
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:20,669
Luo Shen.

94
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:23,929
I will never part from you.

95
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:31,787
Shi Qingyi: Hyah!

96
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:37,549
The leader of the army in pursuit: Our superior has ordered the whole army to hunt her down.

97
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:39,059
Don't let her escape!

98
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:40,240
The chasing army: Yes!

99
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,608
Shi Qingyi: Hyah!

100
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,489
The leader of the pursuing army: Release the arrows! Force her off her horse!

101
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,430
Aim for the arms and legs, avoid the vitals!

102
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,330
Make sure to catch her alive, and there will give a big reward for you!

103
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,700
(Shi Qingyi dodges, grabs an incoming arrow, and flings it back.)

104
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:59,104
(The archer falls off his horse.)

105
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,619
(Shi Qingyi urges her horse into a gallop.)

106
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:23,672
(Modern-day, early morning)

107
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:27,668
(Shi Qingyi wakes up)

108
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:39,279
Shi Qingyi: Hmm… Why did I have that dream again,

109
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:42,062
I dreamt about that woman again.

110
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,568
Shi Qingyi: **Why I can never see her face clearly?**

111
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,760
**When I wake up, I can't remember her name.**

112
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:06,901
**I can't hear what she says very clearly either.**

113
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:12,168
**Who is she?**

114
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:37,283
TV Background Voice: Good morning,  everyone.

115
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:40,194
Today is Saturday, June 9, 2012.

116
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,593
Welcome to today's episode of The Morning News.

117
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,253
Here's ……

118
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,784
Shi Qingyi: Hey, Uncle Yang, good morning.

119
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:49,244
Have you eaten breakfast yet?

120
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:50,670
Uncle Yang: Yes, I've just eaten.

121
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,164
Shishi.

122
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,455
You're going to the Wuse store in Furong Lane today to get the goods from that guy Chen Jingfa.

123
00:07:57,057 --> 00:07:58,965
When do you plan to head there?

124
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:02,566
I have to write my thesis in the morning, the professor is pushing me for it.

125
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,076
I'll go there at noon, still in time.

126
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:06,805
Uncle Yang: Okay.

127
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:10,696
You are now studying with Professor Yin Qing as a graduate student in the Department of Archaeology.

128
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:12,916
It's your third year of study, no wonder you're busy.

129
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,555
Still, your thesis is the most important thing.

130
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:17,816
Don't worry about the antique business over at Moyan Store,

131
00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:20,025
You have me to take care of it.

132
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:21,525
Shi Qingyi: Thank you, uncle Yang.

133
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:24,055
Since I have you to help me with the store, I have nothing to worry about.

134
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,185
Uncle Yang: By the way.

135
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:28,206
Last time, Chen Jingfa took advantage of the fact that A Dong is a novice.

136
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:32,215
He switched an ancient inkstone with a fake one and give us the fake.

137
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:34,786
He thought we wouldn't know about it.

138
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:36,775
This time, since you're going to get the goods yourself.

139
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:39,296
We should knock some sense into his head.

140
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:44,566
Let him see how powerful Shi Qingyi, the Moyan Store can be.

141
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,125
Shi Qingyi: What power are you talking about?

142
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,956
Uncle Yang, you're making fun of me again.

143
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:51,145
Uncle Yang: hahaha.

144
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:52,835
Shi Qingyi: I will get it done

145
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:55,950
When I get the goods this afternoon, I'll bring them back immediately.

146
00:08:58,477 --> 00:09:02,360
Uncle Yang, just wait for me at Moyan Store.

147
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:08,394

154
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:35,566
Shi Qingyi: Boss Chen.

155
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:39,346
Please ask your guys to bring out the batch of goods ordered by uncle Yang.

156
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:40,966
I'll count them according to the list.

157
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:42,245
(The sound of a flute in the dark is faint.)

158
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:46,522
Chen Jingfa: A Cheng, go and bring the goods to Boss Shi.

159
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:50,076
A Cheng, why are you standing here?

160
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:53,475
Did you meet a ghost? why don't you go get the goods for Boss Shi?

161
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:54,976
A Cheng: Ah yes …… yes.

162
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:57,206
Sorry boss, I just got lost in thought.

163
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:58,641
I'll go now.

164
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:03,476
Chen Jingfa: Boss Shi, please wait a moment.

165
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:05,026
A Cheng will be back in a moment.

166
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,853
Shi Qingyi: Okay, there is no hurry.

167
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:13,877
A Cheng: Boss Shi, the goods are here.

168
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:16,187
There is one Qing Dynasty snuff bottle and

169
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:17,647
Two pieces of ancient lotus jade.

170
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:19,457
A piece of ancient sword frame of the Qing Dynasty.

171
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:21,126
There is also an orchid stone inkstone.

172
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,106
Please take a look.

173
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:22,917
Shi Qingyi: Thank you.

174
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:35,029
(Shi Qingyi examines the antiques.)

175
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:51,406
Shi Qingyi: Boss Chen.

176
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:53,486
Chen Jingfa: How about these goods?

177
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:56,206
Last time I just sent photos to Moyan Store.

178
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,036
This time is to see the real thing.

179
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:01,665
Do you feel satisfied with these goods?

180
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:07,304
Shi Qingyi: Everything is very good.

181
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:12,638
Chen Jingfa: **She even didn't notice this snuff bottle is a forgery**

182
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,116
**And said the stuff is very good?**

183
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,557
**With her poor eyesight.**

184
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:19,567
**How can she open Moyan Store and become the boss.**

185
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:22,067
Chen Jingfa: Boss Shi, your vision is beyond words.

186
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,963
These goods are all the best.

187
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:27,917
Shi Qingyi: Since Boss Chen said it is the best quality.

188
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,504
They must be the best.

189
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:32,776
The other three items are all good.

190
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,747
But recently, snuff bottles are not popular in the antique market.

191
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:38,226
The snuff bottles we bought in the store are not selling well.

192
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,631
I don't want this snuff bottle.

193
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,707
Chen Jingfa: This snuff bottle is the property of Shen Guangwen, a university scholar during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty.

194
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,748
Boss Shi you are a connoisseur.

195
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:52,151
You should be able to see the value of this item.

196
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:53,880
Other snuff bottles do not sell well.

197
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,400
This one, how can it be not selling well?

198
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,820
Shi Qingyi: I know this is Shen Guangwen's stuff.

199
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,588
But this snuff bottle of the great scholar Shen.

200
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,971
Maybe the smell of snuff was too heavy in that year.

201
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:06,799
It's a bit strange.

202
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,629
I smell like glass and pine.

203
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,289
I don't like the smell, a smell of taint.

204
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,096
Chen Jingfa: **Now I know boss Shi is obviously a smiling fox.**

205
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:22,871
**She have already noticed it.**

206
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,619
**And she provokes me indirectly.**

207
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,189
**It seems that she noticed in the last batch of goods**

208
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:29,529
**The antique inkstone is faulty.**

209
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,618
**Now she's here to warn me.**

210
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,688
**I can't offend her again.**

211
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,696
**I'd better give her some benefits.**

212
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:40,525
Shi Qingyi: What? Boss Chen, you do not smell this smell?

213
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:43,036
Chen Jingfa: No …… did not smell.

214
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,307
Shi Qingyi: Oh yes.

215
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:48,716
The glass and pine are the raw material that will be mixed in the fake jade.

216
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:51,075
The top quality one in your hands

217
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:53,687
how can it be a forgery?

218
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:54,976
Right?

219
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:57,276
Chen Jingfa: Yes …… how can it be?

220
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,726
Boss Shi, that is impossible.

221
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:02,716
I do honest business.

222
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:05,067
I also believe in you.

223
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,507
But speaking of which.

224
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:10,036
The last time you sold us that ancient inkstone

225
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:12,687
It also has a different smell.

226
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:15,962
I don't really like that smell anyway.

227
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:20,975
Chen Jingfa: Since Boss Shi does not like the smell of the snuff bottle.

228
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:24,536
Then just take the remaining ones.

229
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:27,617
Speaking of which, Yang and I are old acquaintances.

230
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,947
But it's the first time I meet you.

231
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:31,336
First time meeting.

232
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:35,167
I shall give you a small gift today

233
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,465
as a favor.

234
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:41,086
All the antiques on the right shelf,

235
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,917
Boss Shi, if you like any of them.

236
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,716
just pick the one you like and take it back.

237
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:47,346
Shi Qingyi: You're very kind, Boss Chen.

238
00:13:55,016 --> 00:14:00,042
(Shi Qingyi walks towards the antique shelf.)

239
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:03,357
(She saw a red jade bracelet.)

240
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:07,680
(Tanxuling original music: red jade bracelet)

241
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,648
Shi Qingyi: ** Strange, this red jade bracelet ……**

242
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:18,499
(She picks up the bracelet.)

243
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,987
Shi Qingyi: Then I'll pick this red jade bracelet.

244
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:28,437
I just saw it when I came in and I really like it.

245
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:31,147
Thank you for your kindness, Boss Chen.

246
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:33,716
Chen Jingfa: ** Didn't she have a very good judge of goods?**

247
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:36,046
**How come she chose a cheap one?**

248
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:40,177
**This red jade bracelet  was just bought from a farmer and cost me only a thousand dollars.**

249
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:42,047
Shi Qingyi: Yo, Boss Chen.

250
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,456
You're even happier than I was when I got the gift.

251
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:45,956
Chen Jingfa: No, no, no.

252
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:49,146
I am only happy that you are happy, Boss Shi.

253
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:52,536
This red jade bracelet is a genuine antique.

254
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,354
You really have a good sight.

255
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:59,485
Shi Qingyi: It is an antique, that's right.

256
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,317
I've already paid a deposit of 50,000 yuan a while ago.

257
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:06,496
The rest of the money, uncle Yang will pay to your card tomorrow.

258
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:08,768
Chen Jingfa: Yes, thank you, Boss Shi.

259
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:12,667
Let's have pleasant cooperation later.

260
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:15,387
Shi Qingyi: In fact, cooperation is pleasant or not.

261
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:17,225
The main thing depends on you, Boss Chen.

262
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,242
I've always been very pleasant.

263
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:25,148
Shi Qingyi: Boss Chen, then I'll go back first.

264
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:26,257
Goodbye.

265
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:30,754
Chen Jingfa: Okay, take care.

266
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:38,393
Hey, the little fox is quite difficult to deal with.

267
00:15:52,727 --> 00:16:01,714
(Shi Qingyi returns to the car and puts the goods away.)

268
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:10,447
(She took out the red jade bracelet and put it on.)

269
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:19,257
(TanXuLing original soundtrack: red jade bracelet)

270
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:21,918
Shi Qingyi: (examining the bracelet) this red jade bracelet ……

271
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:23,301
Is really interesting.

272
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:28,768
Shi Qingyi: Hmm?

273
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,418
Ning Ning: Don't move.

274
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:31,338
Shi Qingyi: You…

275
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,228
Ning Ning: (Lowered voice) Don't turn back yet.

276
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:35,577
Do as I say.

277
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,728
Otherwise, I'll shoot you.

278
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:40,696
Shi Qingyi: **I can't afford to mess with her.**

279
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:43,858
**I have to delay with her as long as possible.**

280
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,448
Shi Qingyi: I… I'm a good citizen.

281
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,470
Even if you don't point a gun at me.

282
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:53,336
I will …… obey and not move around.

283
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,740
Ning Ning: Good citizen?

284
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,560
You have watched too much television?

285
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,180
I don't watch much TV.

286
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:03,370
I usually spend more time on the computer.

287
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,750
Ning Ning: Shut up

288
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,921
Shi Qingyi: This section of the road has electronic surveillance.

289
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:10,282
You're holding a gun, don't mess around.

290
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:12,260
Everything will be captured.

291
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,769
Ning Ning: I am wearing a mask, the gun is also covered.

292
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,328
I'm not afraid of electronic surveillance.

293
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:22,409
Shi Qingyi:  I don't have much cash on me, and I don't have my card with me.

294
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:23,839
If you want a car, then

295
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,390
I give the car keys to you, you drive away.

296
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,740
Please don't hurt me.

297
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,060
Ning Ning: I don't want cash, I don't want cards

298
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,370
and I don't want your car either.

299
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,130
I want the red jade bracelet on your hand.

300
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,229
Shi Qingyi: I'll take the bracelet off and give it to you right away.

301
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:44,099
Ning Ning: Don't move. You can't take it off.

302
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,386
Shi Qingyi: What?

303
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,538
Shi Qingyi: **How could this happen?**

304
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,485
Ning Ning: Don't toss and turn.

305
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,826
I just told you.

306
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,586
After you put it on, you can not take it off.

307
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:02,387
To take it off.

308
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:05,356
Unless you become a dead person.

309
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:07,027
Or.

310
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:10,356
Cut off the hand that you wear the bracelet.

311
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,945
Shi Qingyi: So.

312
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,131
Do you want to kill me?

313
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,030
Or are you going to cut off my hand?

314
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,629
Ning Ning: Neither.

315
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,030
This red jade bracelet is not yet able to touch blood.

316
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,628
I want you to come with me.

317
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:24,940
I can go with you.

318
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:26,815
As long as you don't hurt me.

319
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:30,096
Can I ask you a few questions?

320
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:33,417
I don't understand

321
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,428
what you're doing to me right now.

322
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:38,238
Ning Ning:  Ask more, die earlier.

323
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:39,598
Shi Qingyi: I'm not asking any more questions, then.

324
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:42,767
Just can you let me tie my shoelaces?

325
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:43,816
The laces are a little loose.

326
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,900
Ning Ning: Why do you a good citizen has so many things to do?

327
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,856
Go ahead, hurry.

328
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:55,788
(Shi Qingyi ties her shoelaces and puts down a small object.)

329
00:18:57,411 --> 00:18:59,651
Shi Qingyi: It's okay, thanks.

330
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:02,072
Ning Ning: Behave yourself and go.

331
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,622
Shi Qingyi: **I hope uncle Yang can see what I left on the side of the car when I was tying my shoelaces.**

332
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:09,780
**Know that something happened to me and go to find me.**

333
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:19,857
Ning Ning: Get in the car.

334
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,301
Ye Zhen: Hi, big beauty, how are you?

335
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:32,822
Shi Qingyi: Hello

336
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,672
Your sunglasses are very handsome.

337
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,424
Ye Zhen: Sister Ning, this beauty is really nice.

338
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:40,752
Very interesting.

339
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,213
We've kidnapped her.

340
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:46,553
But it looks like she's not afraid of us at all.

341
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,332
Gutsy.

342
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:50,883
Ning Ning: Behave yourself.

343
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:53,863
Nice guy, but not yours.

344
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:58,020
Ye Zhen: Hey, sister Ning, look what you said.

345
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:02,213
This lady, you are not lucky.

346
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,381
Today our boss will have to use this ghost chain on your hand.

347
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:06,270
**Ghost chains?**

348
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,053
We looked for a long time before.

349
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:12,833
Finally heard that it was sold to a man named Chen Jingfa in Furong Lane.

350
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:16,292
Today we were going to Chen Jingfa's Wuse store to get the goods.

351
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:19,963
But unfortunately, you wear it at first.

352
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,398
This is fate.

353
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:27,426
Ye Zhen: But don't worry, ghost chains are contraindicated by blood.

354
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,545
We will not cut off your hand.

355
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,686
to avoid staining with blood.

356
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:34,836
You just need to obediently follow us.

357
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:39,117
Shi Qingyi: Will I die?

358
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:42,497
Ye Zhen: Miss, you ask me such a professional question.

359
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:45,336
I'm not sure how I can answer you.

360
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:48,447
Shi Qingyi: You are a professional about that, aren't you?

361
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,086
You have a pistol and a short-handled saber hanging on your belt.

362
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:53,154
It's not for show, right?

363
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:56,877
Ye Zhen: Miss, what is your name?

364
00:20:56,877 --> 00:21:00,787
You are gutsy, I like you very much.

365
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:03,831
Shi Qingyi: My name is Shi Qingyi.

366
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:06,411
Ye Zhen: Miss Shi, I'm Ye Zhen.

367
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:08,870
This is Ning Ning, the one who brought you here.

368
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,650
We all call her Sister Ning.

369
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,541
We're going to the boss's place to meet up with him.

370
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,074
There are also a few brothers.

371
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,803
Also, I tell you.

372
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,403
Although I am a professional.

373
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,163
Since I joined this business.

374
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,633
I have never killed a woman.

375
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,352
So I should feel lucky that

376
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:26,857
You have never killed a woman.

377
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:28,434
Ye Zhen: Haha.

378
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:30,752
Ning Ning: Ye, every time you meet a beautiful woman.

379
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,758
Would you die if you say a few words less?

380
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,170
Don't forget what you do for a living.

381
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,800
Why waste words with her.

382
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,239
Hurry up and tape up your beautiful girl's mouth.

383
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,570
Then seal your own mouth.

384
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:45,581
Ye Zhen: (Makes a gesture of sealing his mouth with his hand) Okay, Sister Ning.

385
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,548
All sealed up, quiet.

386
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,282
(SUV starts)

387
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:34,961
(The Falling Goose Mountain)

388
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:41,606
(Shi Qingyi, Ning Ning, Ye Zhen get out of the car)

389
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:48,551
Ye Zhen: (kindly remind) Miss Shi, we are now at the Falling Goose Mountain

390
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:52,281
The car just climbed the mountain road and it was very bumpy, you have no motion sickness, right?

391
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:55,187
Shi Qingyi: Thank you Mr.Ye, no.

392
00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:59,188
Ning Ning: (annoyed) Ye Zhen, are you out of your mind?

393
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,341
Why did you tell her that this is the Falling Goose Mountain?

394
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:05,761
Do you afraid she doesn't know where she is when she's been kidnapped? right?

395
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,769
Why don't you tell her all your ancestors?

396
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,611
Ye Zhen: Haha sister Ning, do not be angry.

397
00:23:10,611 --> 00:23:11,351
Look at my stupid mouth.

398
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,436
Ning Ning: Fuck you.

399
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:16,919
Ye Zhen: (quietly) Miss Shi.

400
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,039
Sister Ning is just a little mean-mouthed.

401
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,680
Let her scold and it will be fine.

402
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,030
Don't be nervous.

403
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,660
Shi Qingyi: I'm not nervous.

404
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:33,497
(Shi Qingyi is walking in the forest.)

405
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:42,706
Shi Qingyi: Hmm?

406
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,410
The man A: How come they go out for so long?

407
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,090
I'm tired of waiting.

408
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,671
When can we get down to the tomb?

409
00:23:50,671 --> 00:23:52,081
And see what treasures there are inside the tomb.

410
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:54,388
Man B: Hey, it's Ning and Ye Zhen, they're back.

411
00:23:55,741 --> 00:23:58,881
Shi Qingyi: **they actually dug a robber hole here?**

412
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,179
**It turns out that Ning Ning and Ye Zhen and their group.**

413
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:01,685
**Is to do this kind of tomb robbery business.**

414
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:06,888
**Their profession and my major in archaeology are the opposite of each other.**

415
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:10,189
**I must not let them see that I know the stuff in tombs.**

416
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,095
Ning Ning: Brother Dong, it's done.

417
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:20,511
Dong Jun: Ning Ning, what happened to this woman you brought back.

418
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:24,776
I told you to go to Chen Jingfa's place to get the ghost chain.

419
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:27,196
Why bring me back a woman?

420
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:28,855
Ning Ning: originally we went to get the ghost chain.

421
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:30,625
But I was a step late.

422
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,974
She snatched it and wear it first.

423
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,844
You also know the ghost chain ……

424
00:24:34,844 --> 00:24:36,965
Dong Jun: I know the ghost chain can not get blood.

425
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:39,875
No need to cut her hands, feed her some medicine to eat.

426
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:43,126
When poisoned, the blood clogged in the body, and

427
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:44,835
Will not flow to the ghost chain.

428
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,556
When her body is cold.

429
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:50,424
Then take off the ghost chain from her corpse.

430
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,123
Shu Qingyi: **…… calm.**

431
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:56,557
Ning Ning: Brother Dong, now only she can open the door at the bottom.

432
00:24:56,557 --> 00:25:00,077
We can't let her die yet.

433
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:02,536
Dong Jun: I forgot about that.

434
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,947
Since she is wearing the ghost chain.

435
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:07,455
Then hurry up and take this woman down.

436
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:09,857
Dong Jun: Get up, all of you.

437
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:11,426
Get up, don't dawdle.

438
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,809
Let's go down the hole.

439
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:14,498
Shi Qingyi: **When I am not useful**

440
00:25:14,498 --> 00:25:17,148
**I'm sure they'll kill me.**

441
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,334
**I have to think of countermeasures quickly.**

442
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:25,084
Shi Qingyi: **But they all have guns on them ……**

443
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:26,672
**I have to take my time.**

444
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:29,965
Dong Jun: Go down.

445
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:41,843
Ning Ning: (cold eyes at Shi Qingyi) Shi, you go down first.

446
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:44,855
I'm on guard, don't think about playing tricks.

447
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,375
Shi Qingyi: I see.*

448
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:54,992
Ye Zhen: Miss Shi, this cave is very difficult for ordinary people to enter.

449
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:56,623
Let me carry you down.

450
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:59,444
Shi Qingyi: No, you help me block her sight.

451
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:00,894
Ye Zhen: Oh?

452
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,633
Shi Qingyi: Do not let Ning Ning see me.

453
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,111
Ye Zhen: Okay.

454
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:14,144
(Shi Qingyi along the rope, lightly leap down the cave.)

455
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:29,104
(Ye Zhen comes down from above along the rope)

456
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:30,994
Ye Zhen: (whispering in surprise) I can't believe it.

457
00:26:30,994 --> 00:26:33,334
Miss Shi, you have kung fu?

458
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,464
You're so good at going down the hole and flipping the rope.

459
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:37,994
You seem to be better than even us.

460
00:26:37,994 --> 00:26:40,274
What exactly do you do?

461
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:42,084
Shifu Qingyi: Don't talk nonsense.

462
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:44,194
Even if I know kung fu and can flip ropes

463
00:26:44,194 --> 00:26:46,764
It's not as powerful as real bullets.

464
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:50,073
You give me a shot, I will immediately die.

465
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:52,492
Ye Zhen: (smiling) Don't worry, I can't let you die.

466
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:55,157
I will not say anything.

467
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,203
Ning Ning: (urge from back) hurry up and go, what are you muttering at front.

468
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,642
(Shi Qingyi and others go down along the tomb passage deeper and deeper)

469
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:11,344
(TanXuLing Original soundtrack: Down the tomb)

470
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:29,454
Shi Qingyi: **What they want to open is this door?**

471
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:32,794
Dong Jun: Ning Ning, you let the woman to the front of the door.

472
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:35,894
Ning Ning: Shi, what are you dawdling for?

473
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:38,903
Come over and open the door.

474
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:41,663
See the 18 round holes above the door?

475
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:45,674
Each one is matched with your hand ghost chain outline.

476
00:27:45,674 --> 00:27:49,842
You put your hand into the middle of the hole so that the ghost chain can be stuck.

477
00:27:50,924 --> 00:27:54,143
Did you hear what I said? Ah?

478
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:55,761
Shi Qingyi: Yes.

479
00:27:57,174 --> 00:28:01,892
(Shi Qingyi walks to the door and rubs the engraved letters on the door.)

480
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,582
Shifu Qingyi: (reads the words engraved on the door) Only when the master of the Ghost Chain has come.

481
00:28:09,582 --> 00:28:11,732
This door will be opened.

482
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:18,173
The chains can't get blood and cannot be defiled.

483
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:19,982
Shi Qingyi: So it is.

484
00:28:19,982 --> 00:28:24,301
The words carved on this door is to say that the master of the Ghost Chain must be alive.

485
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:25,392
No wonder just now ……

486
00:28:25,392 --> 00:28:27,794
Ning Ning: Since you know, cut the fucking crap.

487
00:28:27,794 --> 00:28:32,343
The Mater of the Ghost Chain, open the door.

488
00:28:35,094 --> 00:28:37,324
Shi Qingyi: The mechanism hole is so deep.

489
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:40,141
I don't know what's waiting for me inside.

490
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:43,383
If I go in rashly.

491
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:46,751
will I lose my hands?

492
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:51,044
Shi Qingyi: **hands are so important.**

493
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:54,153
Ning Ning: what are you dawdling for?

494
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:55,474
Shi Qingyi:  **No idea.**

495
00:28:55,474 --> 00:28:59,794
**life is more important than a hand.**

496
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:03,869
(Shi Qingyi puts her hand into the doorway)

497
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:13,044
(mechanism opens)

498
00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:33,469
(tomb door opens)

499
00:29:35,243 --> 00:29:36,794
Ye Zhen: (elated) Hey, it's open.

500
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:39,133
This ghost chain really lives up to its name.

501
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:42,334
Quickly, the chamber behind the door is finally ready to enter.

502
00:29:42,334 --> 00:29:46,394
(All step into the tomb)

503
00:29:57,604 --> 00:30:00,794
Zhan Fei: Why is there nothing in this chamber?

504
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:03,350
Only some broken chains.

505
00:30:04,613 --> 00:30:07,464
Ning Ning: Zhan Fei, look over there.

506
00:30:07,464 --> 00:30:09,523
Take a good look at these chains.

507
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:13,469
All gathered in the white jade platform over there.

508
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:27,462
Zhan Fei: Good God, there is a crystal coffin on that white jade platform!

509
00:30:27,462 --> 00:30:30,174
Wealthy, wealthy!

510
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:31,794
Sister Ning has good eyesight.

511
00:30:31,794 --> 00:30:33,457
This is really a coffin to make a fortune!

512
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:37,666
Shu Qingyi: **Lying in the crystal coffin it's seemingly a woman?**

513
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:42,966
Ye Zhen (be on guard) watch out, there is a zongzi in that crystal coffin!

514
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,306
Shi Qingyi (in a trance): This is ……

515
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,731
Ye Zhen: (alarmed, stopping Shi Qingyi) Miss Shi, you do not know these,

516
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:50,829
Don't go there first, that's a zongzi!

517
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:54,320
Like these bodies lying in the coffin of the tomb is called zongzi.

518
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,400
Once they have absorbed the breath of the living.

519
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,050
they will probably become active.

520
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,050
Sit up from the coffin.

521
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,669
And attack people!

522
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:03,060
Only to use black donkey's hoof, the ward off evil things that restrain the dumplings specifically

523
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,169
and put it into the mouth of the zongzi.

524
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:07,070
The zongzi can no longer attack people!

525
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,300
Sister Ning, get the black donkey's hoof out!

526
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,090
Ning Ning: I'll take it when you tell me to?

527
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,480
Who are you, Ye?

528
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,539
Dong Jun: I have a gun in my hand, why do I need black donkey's trotters?

529
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,759
Eat for yourself?

530
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:20,716
Get your weapon ready, go forward to see.

531
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:25,669
the existence of zongzi is a good news

532
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:29,800
You know that the zongzi carries valuable treasures.

533
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,129
Get a piece of them, we will make a lot of money.

534
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:38,044
(Dong Jun approaches the crystal coffin)

535
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,884
Dong Jun: looks like there are no signs of the zongzi becoming active

536
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,446
Open the coffin.

537
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,436
Others: Yes

538
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,925
(Open the coffin)

539
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,830
Shu Qingyi: (saw the appearance of the woman in the coffin, overlapping sound) this woman ……

540
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,539
Ye Zhen: (awe) my goodness, am I dizzying?

541
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:37,689
This …… zongzi in this coffin looks too ……

542
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,439
too beautiful!

543
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:43,979
Shi Qingyi: **what's going on?**

544
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:49,850
**Why do I want to touch the woman in this coffin?**

545
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,330
Luo Shen: every year, every day in the past,

546
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,789
The time I spent with you, I want to remember.

547
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:03,610
Every moment, I do not want to forget.

548
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,167
I don't want to forget either.

549
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:07,603
Luo Shen: Qingyi.

550
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:13,374
No matter how the dynasties change outside, how time goes.

551
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:17,804
I will never, ever part with you.

552
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:20,535
Shi Qingyi: Neither will I.

553
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:22,004
Luo Shen.

554
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:26,404
I will never be separated from you.

555
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,703
Ye Zhen: There is a vermilion dot on her eyebrow.

556
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:32,333
Her left hand is missing a little finger hey?

557
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:36,096
Ning Ning: This person is dead, what do you care what she is missing.

558
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:38,035
Ye Zhen: such a superb beauty.

559
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:44,085
It's a pity that she's missing her little finger.

560
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:46,096
Shi Qingyi: (in a trance) …… what's going on.

561
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,932
Ye Zhen: Miss Shi, Miss Shi, are you okay?

562
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:52,243
Shi Qingyi: (back to her senses) no …… nothing.

563
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,996
Ye Zhen: Miss Shi, don't be afraid.

564
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:57,596
She is just a dead person.

565
00:33:57,596 --> 00:33:59,846
To put it bluntly, it's just a zongzi.

566
00:33:59,846 --> 00:34:01,196
Look at her

567
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:03,386
She won't get up to attack you.

568
00:34:03,746 --> 00:34:05,705
Dong Jun: Zhan Fei, you go over there.

569
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:08,015
See what goodies that zongzi is carrying.

570
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:10,763
Zhan Fei: Okay, Brother Dong.

571
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:22,186
Zhan Fei: Look at the woman in the coffin, the skin is watery.

572
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,896
So beautiful ……

573
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:27,764
Damn, I've never seen such a good-looking person in my life.

574
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:29,755
I did not expect her to become a zongzi

575
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:33,396
What a fucking waste.

576
00:34:33,396 --> 00:34:37,366
Ning Ning: (cynical and poisonous) Zhan Fei, no matter how beautiful she is

577
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,596
It's not your turn to feel sorry for the waste, huh?

578
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:42,896
Look at your behavior.

579
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:44,275
Dong Jun: Cut the crap.

580
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:46,676
People are dead, what can be the point.

581
00:34:46,676 --> 00:34:48,359
Don't dawdle.

582
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,956
Hurry up and strip her clothes.

583
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,786
These clothes have not decayed for so many years.

584
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:53,835
It must be worth a lot of money.

585
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:57,246
And see if there are any other treasures on her body.

586
00:34:57,246 --> 00:34:58,366
Get it all off.

587
00:34:58,366 --> 00:35:00,325
The corpse is not decomposing.

588
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:02,456
Either it was filled with medicine.

589
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:05,047
Or there are face-keep pearls in her mouth.

590
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:06,206
Take them all out.

591
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:08,315
Zhan Fei: I'm coming.

592
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,735
Let me search this beauty's body.

593
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:14,229
Shi Qingyi: (coldly) Take your dirty hands away.

594
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,446
Zhan Fei: (furious) What do you mean?

595
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:19,565
Dare You say it again?

596
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:23,565
Shi Qingyi: (suppressing anger) I said, take your dirty hands away.

597
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:25,516
You have no right to touch her.

598
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:28,507
Zhan Fei: You're fucking tired of living, aren't you?

599
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:30,706
I'll shoot ……ouch!

600
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:33,026
Shi Qingyi: Do not move!

601
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:35,385
Zhan Fei: (panic) you …… you calm down.

602
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:37,276
This gun is not a joke!

603
00:35:37,276 --> 00:35:38,546
Dong Jun: That's really unexpected.

604
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:41,446
You pretended to be weak all the way

605
00:35:41,446 --> 00:35:43,475
Hide your ability.

606
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,931
You even know kung fu!

607
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:48,667
Shi Qingyi: If you guys dare to move, I'll kill him immediately!

608
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:49,736
Ye Zhen: (nervous) Miss Shi.

609
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:51,596
Zhan Fei: Boss, brothers, don't move.

610
00:35:51,596 --> 00:35:52,995
Do not move!

611
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:58,621
Dong Jun: Shi, Zhan Fei is just a cheap life.

612
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:01,432
Do you think you can threaten me?

613
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:02,642
(Dong Jun fires, hitting Zhan Fei's leg.)

614
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:05,061
Zhan Fei: (screams) Ahhh!

615
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:07,411
Zhan Fei: Dong Jun, you cold-blooded beast, I'll fuck your whole family!

616
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:09,600
Dong Jun: Shi, did you see?

617
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,000
Since I was able to cripple Zhan Fei's leg with this shot.

618
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,401
In the next shot, I will be able to blow your head off.

619
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:19,070
Since you know we are here to robe tomb.

620
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,530
I will definitely not let you go out alive.

621
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,580
Otherwise, if you leak messages later.

622
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,242
I will have to take responsibility.

623
00:36:26,981 --> 00:36:30,390
(Shi Qingyi throws Zhan Fei away, Zhan Fei falls to the ground)

624
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,051
Shi Qingyi: I knew it already.

625
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:35,611
In front of you desperadoes.

626
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:38,471
No matter what I do, I will due finally.

627
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:44,222
(Shi Qingyi walked over to the crystal coffin and gazed at the woman in the coffin.)

628
00:36:45,605 --> 00:36:48,514
Dong Jun: Seeing that you are so nervous about the woman in the coffin.

629
00:36:48,514 --> 00:36:50,295
If you die next to her.

630
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,135
You shouldn't be too sad, right?

631
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,606
Ye Zhen: Boss, I beg you, please don't kill her.

632
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:58,084
I promise Miss Shi will never tell others.

633
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:00,375
Dong Jun: Your guarantee is a ghost.

634
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,216
The mouth is on her face.

635
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:03,935
If she is alive

636
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:06,506
she wouldn't have spilled the beans about this today?

637
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:08,425
I think she is not a simple person.

638
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:09,675
She knows kung fu.

639
00:37:09,675 --> 00:37:10,996
And so disobedient.

640
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:13,026
How dare she threaten me?

641
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:14,036
How can you guarantee?

642
00:37:14,036 --> 00:37:15,165
Ye Zhen: Dong ……

643
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:16,456
Dong Jun: Shut up.

644
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:20,216
(chains shaking)

645
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:22,395
Man A: boss, boss, look!

646
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:24,557
Man B: Boss, look at the woman in the coffin, she …… she ……

647
00:37:24,557 --> 00:37:26,517
Dong Jun: shout what shout, did you see the ghost?

648
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:29,906
Ning Ning (shivering): Brother Dong, got up, she got up, you ……

649
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:31,466
Dong Jun: What up?

650
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,797
Ning Ning, why are you making a fuss too?

651
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:35,597
Shi Qingyi: (surprised)

652
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:42,216
Original Soundtrack of Tan Xu Ling: "Luo Shen"

653
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,469
Shi Qingyi: **There is no embroidery in the green pines**

654
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:51,769
**But there is an exiled goddess in the human world**

655
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,249
**Is this the kind of person the poem is talking about?**

656
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:58,878
**How can there be ……**

657
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:02,159
**Such a good-looking person in this world**

658
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:24,347
Luo Shen: You are really noisy

659
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,596
Dong: Ahhhhhh the zongzi is getting up!

660
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:35,576
Shi Qingyi: Watch out! 

661
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:42,159
(Luo Shen holds Shi Qingyi in her arms)

662
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,056
Luo Shen: You ……

663
00:38:47,229 --> 00:38:49,770
Qingyi?

664
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,272
Shi Qingyi: Don't …… don't just stand there!

665
00:38:57,272 --> 00:38:59,359
They have guns!

666
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:03,341
Luo Shen: Hmm? Guns?

667
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:20,787
(Bullets fly towards them, Luo Shen dodges swiftly, kicking the attackers aside)

668
00:39:21,298 --> 00:39:23,088
Dong: Ah!

669
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,070
(Machinery works)

670
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,860
Ning Ning: **What's going on?**

671
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,050
**Brother Dong was kicked and landed on the mechanism of the tomb door.**

672
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:36,015
**Now the door will close soon, I have to get out of here!**

673
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:42,184
**A group of good-for-nothings.**

674
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,875
Luo Shen: Qingyi! I'll heal your wounds.

675
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:52,499
Shi Qingyi: Go!

676
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,030
The tomb door …… The tomb door is about to close

677
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,705
If the tomb door is closed, we can't …… go back the same way

678
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,440
Luo Shen: Qingyi!

679
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,720
Ye Zhen: Miss Shi, go quickly!

680
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:10,850
Qingyi, don't be afraid, I'll take you out of here!

681
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,470
(Using qinggong to fly up, Luo Shen carries Qingyi away)

682
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,250
Ye Zhen: She didn't even use the nylon rope, she just flew up!

683
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,920
Grandpa and Grandma, this ……

684
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,600
Is this white-clothed zongzi using the legendary qinggong?

685
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,230
Stepping on snow without a trace! Ling Bo Wei Bu!

686
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,669
The wuxia novels are true!

687
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:38,175
(Stones roll down, tomb door closes)

688
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:50,346
(Falling Goose Mountain)

689
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:14,759
Luo Shen: Qingyi, Qingyi

690
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:17,710
Shi Qingyi: Hmmm……

691
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,620
Luo Shen: …… I have to get this dart out as soon as possible.

692
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:31,329
Shi Qingyi：No …… it hurts ……

693
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:33,959
Luo Shen: Good girl, calm down

694
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:37,978
This dart is so powerful that it is extremely dangerous to leave it in your body

695
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:40,536
We need to use a dagger to remove it

696
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:42,669
Qingyi, bear with it for a while

697
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:46,497
Shi Qingyi: You …… I ……

698
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:49,554
Shi Qingyi: Mmmmm ……

699
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:56,445
Luo Shen: Qingyi, I'm going to take out the dart for you

700
00:41:57,317 --> 00:42:02,317
Shi Qingyi: Mmmmm!

701
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:08,711
(Luo Shen uses a dagger to cut a strip of white cloth from her robes to bandage Shi Qingyi)

702
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:23,880
Shi Qingyi：You…… who are you?

703
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:34,499
Luo Shen: …… Did you

704
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:37,152
forget me again?

705
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,287
Shi Qingyi: Of course I recognize you!

706
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:45,757
You are ……

707
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:49,388
You are the ancient zongzi

708
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:54,803
who woke up in the crystal coffin in the tomb just now

709
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:01,547
Luo Shen: Silly girl, I'm not a zongzi

710
00:43:02,118 --> 00:43:04,336
I'm your wife

711
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:07,636
Shi Qingyi: …… wife?

712
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,889
I'm a woman.

713
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:17,193
How can I have a …… wife?

714
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:21,662
Luo Shen: (stunned) Qingyi, you ……

715
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:29,087
Shi Qingyi：Water, I’m so …… thirsty.

716
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:33,239
Luo Shen：All right, you stay here for a while

717
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,843
I am going to fetch water, I will be back soon

718
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:41,775
Don't be afraid, wait for me.

719
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:47,259
(Luo Shen leaves, using qinggong.)

720
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:50,649

730
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:21,020
I can't forgive this kind of hooliganism

731
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,989
just because she's an ancient
