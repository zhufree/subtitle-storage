1
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:18,450
(Hospital ward)

2
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,355
(Shi Qingyi is unconscious and pants gently)

3
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,225
Nurse: Mr. Yang, Miss Shi Qingyi is in stable condition now,

4
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:23,736
The doctor said she should wake up soon,

5
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:24,926
You don't have to worry too much.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,813
Lao Yang: Okay, thank you, nurse.

7
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:33,980
Luo Shen: Qingyi.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,245
Luo Shen: Qingyi,

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,100
I'm your wife.

10
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,650
Shi Qingyi: Hmm... hmmm.

11
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,300
(Shi Qingyi wakes up)

12
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,525
Lao Yang: Shishi!

13
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:04,685
Shi Qingyi: ...Uncle Yang.

14
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:06,775
Lao Yang: Thanks to the old ancestors for their blessings.

15
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,625
You've been sleeping for a day and a night, you're finally awake!

16
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,825
Shi Qingyi: Umm....

17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,250
I have been...... (Lao Yang: Shishi, slow down.)

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,440
sleeping for a day and a night?

19
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:23,675
Lao Yang: I'll raise the head of the bed up for you.

20
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,975
Shi Qingyi: Thank you, uncle Yang.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,825
Lao Yang: Don't worry,

22
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,025
the doctor has operated on you.

23
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:35,763
There's nothing seriously wrong.

24
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:39,000
But you've lost too much blood, you need more rest.

25
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,466
Lao Yang: Come, have some water.

26
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:43,275
Shi Qingyi: Ok.

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,550
Shi Qingyi: (remembered something) **......?**

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,625
**Water...**

29
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:02,345
**Oh wait ......**

30
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:04,175
**I was rescued from the ancient tomb by the woman in white**

31
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:05,370
**who got up from the crystal coffin.**

32
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,245
Luo Shen: Don't be afraid. I'll take you out of here.

33
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:11,931
**The woman said she was going to find me water to drink…**

34
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,500
Luo Shen: You stay here for a while.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,631
I'll go to get water and will be back soon.

36
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,756
**Now I am in the hospital being cared for.**

37
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:20,406
**What about that woman?**

38
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,947
**Now thinking about it, she is definitely not a zongzi,**

39
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:26,736
**but a living person.**

40
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:30,111
**After all, when I was held in her arms,**

41
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:33,200
**I can feel her warmth and breath**

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,119
**What's more, she can also speak.**

43
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,800
(Luo Shen: Don't be afraid, Luo Shen: Wait for me)

44
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:40,600
**Hundreds of years are like one day in the ancient tomb**

45
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:42,506
**She…**

46
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:44,200
**She should be an ancient person**

47
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,056
**who suddenly came to modern times.**(Lao Yang: Shishi?)

48
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:49,521
Lao Yang: Shishi.

49
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:50,807
Shi Qingyi: (in a trance) Ah?

50
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,095
Lao Yang: What are you thinking about?

51
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:55,795
You've been staring into space for so long.

52
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:58,866
You've nearly finished the water, but you are still drinking.

53
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:03,206
Shi Qingyi: I... just got a little distracted.

54
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:06,071
Uncle Yang, please put the cup away for me.

55
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,281
Lao Yang: Ok, I'll peel an apple for you as a snack,

56
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,206
then go out and buy some porridge later.

57
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,856
Shi Qingyi: (thinking) **Can an ordinary person**

58
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:19,246
**live in an ancient tomb for so many years?**

59
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:21,656
**Why didn't time leave**

60
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:23,081
**any traces on her?**

61
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:26,056
Lao Yang: Ah, what porridge would you like?

62
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:29,656
Shi Qingyi: Anything light will do.

63
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:32,256
By the way, uncle Yang,

64
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:34,246
Is there any person in the world

65
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:38,065
who is able to sleep for hundreds of years

66
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:39,325
without eating or drinking.

67
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,046
And then wake up again

68
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,680
still looking like before?

69
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:49,206
Lao Yang: Shishi, why are you suddenly asking me about this?

70
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,776
Shi Qingyi: You know, I like these strange things,

71
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,252
I want to know more.

72
00:03:57,256 --> 00:04:00,581
I heard that there is a kind of water lily with a very hard seed shell,

73
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,125
the seeds lie buried in the mud, 

74
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,881
and need to be dormant for a long time.

75
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:06,181
After a few hundred years, 

76
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,371
the dormancy of water lily seeds finally ends and

77
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:09,881
the flowers bloom again.

78
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:14,227
And this flower is from several hundred years ago.

79
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:19,406
Do you think there is any possibility of humans doing the same?

80
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:27,906
Lao Yang: If I tell you, it is very likely,

81
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:31,006
Will you believe it?

82
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:32,506
Shi Qingyi: Tell me more?

83
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:35,597
Lao Yang: The effect of drugs.

84
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:39,081
Or the art of tortoise breath.

85
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:40,481
Shi Qingyi: (becoming interested) Oh?

86
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:44,700
Lao Yang: In fact, in ancient times, the art of alchemy was prevalent.

87
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,310
There were all kinds of magical elixirs,

88
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,500
and numerous secret evil arts, curses, poisons.

89
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,930
That level of magic

90
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,000
is not what we modern urbanites can understand.

91
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,399
Shi Qingyi: ... Secret arts.

92
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:00,965
Lao Yang: Yes

93
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,465
Most of these things

94
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:06,754
have been lost.

95
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:08,664
Even if a small number of them were handed down,

96
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:10,816
they have been kept secret.

97
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:12,450
People now,

98
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,040
in fact, know only a drop in the ocean

99
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,774
about the thoughts, behaviors and secrets of the ancients.

100
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,390
Shi Qingyi: That's true,

101
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,403
I also think ancient people are very mysterious.

102
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:27,665
Lao Yang: For example, the question you just asked,

103
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:31,624
I think if a person can take some kind of pill,

104
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,475
or use a secret art such as turtle breath,

105
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:38,094
The body's metabolism will stop

106
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:40,885
in a state of deep sleep.

107
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:42,974
But as long as there is a big stimulus from the outside world,

108
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:45,325
Or the drugs or secret arts lose their effectiveness,

109
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:48,144
This person will wake up again,

110
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,005
their Physical functions will be restored,

111
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:52,400
And they will become a normal person.

112
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,260
Shi Qingyi: In other words, when such a person falls into her deep sleep,

113
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,525
Time stops for her, doesn't it?

114
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,590
Uncle Yang: Yes.

115
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,475
Shi Qingyi: (Thinking) **I see... Interesting.**

116
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,313
Shi Qingyi: By the way, uncle Yang, 

117
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:18,475
who brought me to the hospital?

118
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:21,429
Lao Yang: Some mountain climbers saw you in a coma at Luoyan mountain,

119
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,198
And took you to the hospital.

120
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:25,309
Shi Qingyi: (worried)**The woman went to find water for me,**

121
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:27,268
**What if she doesn't see me when she comes back?**

122
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:30,168
Lao Yang: Fortunately, you have your mobile phone on you. The last call in the mobile phone is for me,

123
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:33,188
I got a call from the hospital and came right away.

124
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:35,768
Lao Yang: Come, eat some apple.

125
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:36,838
Shi Qingyi: Ok.

126
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:41,233
Lao Yang: Speaking of it,

127
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,842
The doctor said you were shot in the shoulder,

128
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:46,033
But the bullet has been removed,

129
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,238
And a simple bandage was wrapped around your wound.

130
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:52,763
But how did you get shot for no reason?

131
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:53,903
Shi Qingyi: Huh? It's raining.

132
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:58,934
Oh, I was kidnapped and brought to Luoyan mountain on the outskirts of the city,

133
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:02,154
In the confusion, I was shot.

134
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:04,323
Lao Yang: You said you were kidnapped,

135
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,514
Which bastard in Changsha did it?

136
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:07,520
Who dares to touch a member of the Shi family?

137
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,364
Do they want to die?

138
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:10,874
Shi Qingyi: I don't know,

139
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:13,938
I didn't even see what they looked like. Let it go.

140
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,538
Shi Qingyi: **It's too complicated,**

141
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,913
**The secret is probably very deep,**

142
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,250
**Don't let uncle Yang worry.**

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,290
**And if uncle Yang knows**

144
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,920
**He will definitely tell…**

145
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,184
**Shi Yeran.**

146
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:33,009
Lao Yang: You don't know. I was worried to death before.

147
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,439
You went out for so long in the afternoon and didn't come back,

148
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,118
You didn't answer your mobile phone or your home phone,

149
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:40,237
I just felt that something was wrong.

150
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:42,928
Then I found Furong lane,

151
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:44,729
I saw your car parked there,

152
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:47,809
And this thing had fallen beside the tire.

153
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,243
Here, put it away.

154
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:53,654
Shi Qingyi: Luckily you found it.

155
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:55,555
Lao Yang: Fortunately, the ring is small

156
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,454
so no one saw it and picked it up.

157
00:07:57,454 --> 00:08:01,659
I remember this ring was a birthday present from your aunt when she was still alive,

158
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:03,284
You like it so much,

159
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:05,774
I'm sure you wouldn't have left it lying around,

160
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:09,795
And I was right, something really did happen.

161
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:13,025
Shi Qingyi: It happened suddenly. I was also taking a gamble.

162
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,324
Because the ring my aunt gave me is very valuable,

163
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:17,813
I left it as a sign.

164
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,509
Others don't know, but uncle Yang you can recognize it.

165
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,953
I was hoping no one else would pick it up,

166
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,334
In fact, I was very reluctant to leave it.

167
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,724
Lao Yang: It is fine now that you have the ring back.

168
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:33,709
You just woke up, you need more rest,

169
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,684
I won't talk to you too much,

170
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:41,059
The police will come to you to take a statement.

171
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,459
Shi Qingyi: Uncle Yang, I know what to say to the police,

172
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,284
But don't go after the people who kidnapped me,

173
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:51,909
I don't want to make this a big deal.

174
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,724
Don't say I was shot,

175
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:59,968
Just say I accidentally fell and went to the hospital.

176
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:03,159
Lao Yang: But boss Shi…

177
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,684
Shi Qingyi: (cold) Especially don't tell Shi Yeran.

178
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,684
Lao Yang: ... OK.

179
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,730
Shi Qingyi: Uncle Yang, I want to leave the hospital today.

180
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,840
Lao Yang: I see,

181
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,120
I'll find an excuse to help you transfer hospitals,

182
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,149
You can go home and rest.

183
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,769
Your body is unusual,

184
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,030
You'll recover from even this gunshot wound quickly,

185
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,790
The doctors really shouldn't find out.

186
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,984
Shi Qingyi: Thank you, uncle Yang.

187
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,504
Lao Yang: By the way, Shishi, I almost forgot to give this to you.

188
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:42,459
Shi Qingyi: (surprised) This is …

189
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:46,084
Lao Yang: This is the bandage that the doctor removed from your shoulder before,

190
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:50,045
Others can't tell it. They think it's an ordinary rag,

191
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:54,134
But you know what you and I do.

192
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:56,009
Shi Qingyi: Yes, I see.

193
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,949
This is the best mercerized brocade,

194
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:02,089
It was only produced in the early Ming Dynasty,

195
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:06,829
At that time, only the royal family and nobles or the very rich in the city could afford to wear this.

196
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,618
Unfortunately, this craft has disappeared.

197
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:14,868
Mercerized brocade doesn't decay. It's very valuable,

198
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:16,388
At present, in the antique industry,

199
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:19,059
This kind of thing is a great treasure.

200
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,809
Luo Shen: Qingyi, I'm going to pull out the concealed weapon

201
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:23,113
Lao Yang: Shishi,

202
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:25,092
It's amazing that someone used this mercerized brocade, 

203
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:29,788
which can be called a treasure in the antique industry, to bandages your wound,

204
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:34,034
I've lived to such an old age,

205
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,309
But I couldn't have imagined it.

206
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,574
Shi Qingyi: I'll put this white cloth away.

207
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,415
I know what to do,

208
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:43,913
Uncle Yang, don't worry.

209
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:49,208
Shi Qingyi: **The woman in white,**

210
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,138
**Is she from the Ming Dynasty?**

211
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,287

Season one, Episode Two,

216
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,385
What's your name?

217
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,188
Welcome to listen.

218
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:23,113
(Congested Street)

219
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,922
Radio Hostess: We just received a call from a concerned citizen,

220
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:33,773
At present, Jianshe Road is suddenly blocked by traffic for some unknown reason,

221
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:35,513
Please detour to pass Jianshe Road as far as possible to avoid congestion

222
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:39,118
Passerby: What happened? It's blocked like this,

223
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:40,738
Is it a serial crash or a rear end!

224
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,825
Passerby: Can it be faster? I'm in a hurry!

225
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:47,413
Shi Qingyi: It seems that the traffic jam will last for a long time.

226
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:57,288
(Shi Qingyi takes out the brocade box containing white cloth strips)

227
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:58,963
Shi Qingyi: This cloth strip

228
00:12:03,313 --> 00:12:04,514
wait,

229
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:08,322
Why am I looking at the white cloth that the woman in the ancient tomb used to bandage me,

230
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,023
How many times have I done it already,

231
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:12,688
Is there something… wrong with me?

232
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,788
Is she from the Ming Dynasty?

233
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:20,817
It's so interesting.

234
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:24,588
I don't know if I'll see her again.

235
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,788
Traffic policeman A: Please give way, give way.

236
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:41,648
Please spread out and cooperate with us. Don't get stuck on the road

237
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:43,138
Traffic policeman B: Well, miss,

238
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,619
Please don't stand in the middle of the road like a piece of wood!

239
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,799
Shi Qingyi: (Curious) Huh? 

240
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,299
Passerby: What are they looking at?

241
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:54,038
So strange? I thought a fairy must have come down to earth.

242
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:58,358
Passerby: I don't know. Anyway, it's blocked like anything,

243
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,578
And the cars can't move. Let's go and have a look.

244
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,028
Passerby: This woman looks so beautiful, isn't she a movie star?

245
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:04,918
Why is she walking around dressed like this?

246
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,787
Passerby: What's the fuss,

247
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,487
Hanfu, ancient clothes and so on are very popular now,

248
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:12,487
I see people go to work dressed in hanfu these days.

249
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,508
Passerby: Is she making a movie?

250
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,658
Passerby: It looks like she just escaped from a film set .

251
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:19,687
Shi Qingyi: **Star? Filming? Mental hospital?**

252
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,118
(Traffic policeman B: Miss, you didn't know to avoid the car before It's dangerous.)

253
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:25,318
**What a mess this is.**

254
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:26,587
Passerby: She isn't speaking, she's just looking at the traffic policeman,

255
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:29,818
How can the traffic policeman tolerate it,

256
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:31,938
Shi Qingyi: Excuse me.

257
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:40,918
Shi Qingyi: (Stunned) **This,**

258
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:43,248
**The person blocking the road is**

259
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:45,428
**The woman in white in the coffin?**

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,111
**Am I dreaming?**

261
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:53,225
**Am I Really... Seeing her again?**

262
00:13:56,725 --> 00:14:00,265
Traffic policeman B: I said, miss, do you have facial paralysis or are you mute?

263
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,865
Luo Shen: (Confused, mumbling) Facial paralysis?

264
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:03,831
Traffic policeman B: ...Er.

265
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:06,511
Passerby: The little traffic policeman blushed under her gaze again.

266
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:09,425
Luo Shen: Huh?

267
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,925
Luo Shen: (Surprise) **Qingyi?**

268
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,475
Shi Qingyi: (Nervous) **Did she look at me?**

269
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:22,165
Passerby: This woman is beautiful and strange,

270
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:26,680
Take a picture of her and post it on weibo. That certainly can earn you some kudos.

271
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,750
Shi Qingyi: No photographs. She's my relative. Would you please respect her privacy?

272
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,100
Passerby: Ah? Your relative.

273
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,125
Do you have a beauty gene in your family?

274
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,364
Shi Qingyi: Sorry, comrade traffic police, this is my cousin.

275
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:43,760
She just escaped fromthe municipal psychiatric hospital,

276
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,771
Her brain doesn't work properly,

277
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:49,615
And she likes role playing.

278
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:51,525
Comrade traffic police, don't blame her,

279
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,025
I'll take my cousin back home right away.

280
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,366
Traffic policeman B: Psychosis? Cosplay?

281
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,306
Take her back home quickly,

282
00:14:57,306 --> 00:15:00,716
Look, what's the jam like?

283
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,925
I won't issue a ticket. Take her away,

284
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:04,154
I'm going to evacuate the road.

285
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,875
Take care of your cousin from now on,

286
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,176
Don't let her run wild,

287
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,670
What a strange thing.

288
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,310
Shi Qingyi: Don't worry, comrade traffic police. I'll take my cousin home right away.

289
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,160
Traffic policeman B: Change her clothes quickly,

290
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,050
Dressed like this, she's out of place.

291
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,060
It's not a filming set.

292
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,599
Shi Qingyi: **if I tell you,**

293
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,180
**She is a Ming Dynasty woman who woke up in an ancient tomb,**

294
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,530
**You'll be scared to death.**

295
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,825
Traffic policeman B: Stop watching the fun. There is nothing to see!

296
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:32,435
Shi Qingyi: Cousin,

297
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:36,700
Come on, come home with me.

298
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,850
Luo Shen: Yes.

299
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,825
(Roadside)

300
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:11,475
Shi Qingyi: Well... Let's stop at the roadside first.

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,929
Shi Qingyi: We drove all the way here in my car,

302
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:20,100
Are you feeling well? Are you carsick?

303
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,025
Luo Shen: **Car?**

304
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,400
Shi Qingyi: Do you know what a car means?

305
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,844
Luo Shen: (Seriously) You said this four-wheel box made of iron armor,

306
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,145
Is called a car?

307
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:39,100
It's different from carriages

308
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,250
Shi Qingyi: Ah?

309
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,810
Yeah, yeah, that's what I call a car.

310
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:48,105
Shi Qingyi: (Funny) Four wheel box?

311
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:52,791
What a lovely way you describe it

312
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,625
Luo Shen: Lovely?

313
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,550
Shi Qingyi: I mean... it's interesting

314
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,400
Shi Qingyi: Well, look,

315
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,050
What do you think these two are?

316
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,111
Luo Shen: **this…**

317
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:22,815
**Everything has changed, only…**

318
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:26,100
**Only the appearance of Qingyi has not changed.**

319
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,350
**But she clearly doesn't remember me,**

320
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,075
**She's even testing me with these.**

321
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,550
Shi Qingyi: You...

322
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:45,750
Shi Qingyi: **Did she find that I'm testing her?**

323
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:50,304
**I really shouldn't tease her so much.**

324
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,100
Shi Qingyi: The one that makes a sound is the car horn,

325
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,705
This is the gear lever.

326
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:00,325
You... It doesn't matter if you don't know,

327
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,114
I'll tell you later.

328
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:06,200
Luo Shen: Yes.

329
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,250
Luo Shen: (a little gentle) Is your wound healed?

330
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Shi Qingyi: (stunned) Huh?

331
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,425
Shi Qingyi: Do you think I'm strange?

332
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,931
I was injured two days ago. Now I can walk and run.

333
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,086
Luo Shen: You're not strange.

334
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,625
Shi Qingyi: *Why does it seem that she knows my special skill of rapid recovery?

335
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,550
**Is it an illusion?**

336
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,141
Luo Shen: That day you were hurt ,

337
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,810
I went to get you some water to drink,

338
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,515
When I came back, I found you missing.

339
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:48,533
Shi Qingyi: Sorry,

340
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:50,431
when you went to look for water,

341
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:51,725
I was discovered by another group of people,

342
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,605
I was out of my mind and couldn't leave you a message,

343
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,550
and was sent directly down from the mountain for treatment.

344
00:18:58,424 --> 00:18:59,850
Luo Shen: So,

345
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,700
It's good that you were all right.

346
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:09,125
Shi Qingyi: Thank you for helping me then.

347
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,950
Luo Shen: You don't have to thank me.

348
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,000
Shi Qingyi: It's hot today, are you thirsty?

349
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,075
Luo Shen: Yes

350
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:23,211
Shi Qingyi: Let me undo your seat belt first,

351
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:26,751
You wait for me in the car and I'll buy some beverages.

352
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:43,000
Luo Shen: What do you mean by beverages?

353
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:46,899
Shi Qingyi: Beverages are what you drink.

354
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:51,011
Luo Shen: Is it like wine?

355
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:53,140
Shi Qingyi: wine is a kind of beverage.

356
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,210
Beverages include wine, but wine does not represent all drinks,

357
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,715
It includes other varieties.

358
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,895
Luo Shen: Yes.

359
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:04,425
Shi Qingyi: Wait for me here. I'll be back soon.

360
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,950
Luo Shen: (Whispering) Qingyi.

361
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,825
Shi Qingyi: Shopkeeper, please give me two bottles of coke, chilled.

362
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,060
Boss: Here you are.

363
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:38,950
Shi Qingyi: Thank you.

364
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:50,925
Shi Qingyi: (Thinking as she walk) **These modern things should be very strange to this Ming Dynasty woman,**

365
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:53,800
**But she didn't seem confused or afraid,**

366
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,975
**She's also subconsciously learning.**

367
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:00,229
Shi Qingyi: **She has strong adaptability,**

368
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:02,479
**She is definitely not a simple character.**

369
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:06,305
**I have to find a chance to get to know more about her.**

370
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,250
Shi Qingyi: I'm back.

371
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,000
Here you are, coke.

372
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,225
(Luo Shen drinks coke and frowns)

373
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:31,973
Luo Shen: (Unhappy) Cousin, it tastes bad.

374
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:32,823
Shi Qingyi: (Almost spits out a mouthful of coke) You…

375
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:34,273
Why do you call me cousin?

376
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:36,932
Luo Shen: Just now in front of that noisy freak,

377
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:40,722
Didn't you say I was your cousin?

378
00:21:40,722 --> 00:21:45,623
You said there was something wrong with my brain,

379
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:48,212
Did I hear wrong?

380
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:50,643
Shi Qingyi: ...Er.

381
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,098
Luo Shen: (Chuckles)

382
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:53,798
Shi Qingyi: Don't take it seriously,

383
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:55,342
If I don't say you're a psychotic,

384
00:21:55,342 --> 00:21:56,840
The traffic police won't let you go,

385
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,745
Maybe they'll take you to the Public Security Bureau.

386
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:01,474
Public Security Bureau, in your Dynasty,

387
00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:04,933
It's equivalent to the yamen, which handles criminal cases.

388
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:07,648
Luo Shen: You said our Dynasty.

389
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:13,623
So, you know I'm not from your dynasty?

390
00:22:14,223 --> 00:22:16,977
Shi Qingyi: Wait, let me grab something.

391
00:22:16,977 --> 00:22:19,224
(Shi Qingyi takes out the brocade box)

392
00:22:19,224 --> 00:22:21,052
Shi Qingyi: (Seriously) I'm a graduate student majoring in archaeology,

393
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:22,853
And I run an antique shop,

394
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:25,898
Therefore, I have a certain understanding of historical antiques.

395
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,573
This white cloth is yours.

396
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:31,625
I recognized the cloth as mercerized brocade, right?

397
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:33,700
Luo Shen: Yes.

398
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:37,898
And mercerized brocade was only produced in the Ming Dynasty,

399
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,319
The craft was lost later.

400
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,439
And,

401
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,833
A few days ago, you sat up in the crystal coffin of in the ancient tomb on Luoyan mountain ,

402
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,163
I thought you were a zongzi,

403
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:48,843
Then I realised you were a living human.

404
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,794
If I'm not mistaken,

405
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:52,549
You must be

406
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:54,273
Someone from the Ming Dynasty.

407
00:22:57,473 --> 00:23:00,298
Luo Shen: You are still so clever,

408
00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:03,048
and lovely.

409
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:06,229
Shi Qingyi: Thank you for your praise,

410
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,214
I'm just basing this on the information I have

411
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:09,998
And the evidence in front of me.

412
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:11,673
You're welcome.

413
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:14,672
Luo Shen: Are you not afraid of me?

414
00:23:16,497 --> 00:23:19,158
If others know that I came from an ancient tomb,

415
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:23,358
They must regard me as a monster and avoid me.

416
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,938
But you,

417
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:31,628
You brought me here and talked to me.

418
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:33,803
Shi Qingyi: Why should I be afraid of you?

419
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:37,499
You saved me. You must be a good person.

420
00:23:38,174 --> 00:23:40,574
I'm not an ungrateful person,

421
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:43,403
You saved me so I'll help you.

422
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:46,968
Luo Shen: I'm fine. I don't need help.

423
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:50,413
Shi Qingyi: Don't be angry. I don't mean anything else,

424
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:53,845
I am a good citizen, please believe me.

425
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:56,669
You are now in this strange environment,

426
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,449
There are many things that you won't understand if no one teaches you,

427
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:01,998
That's why I said I would help you.

428
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,550
Luo Shen: Yes.

429
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:09,249
Shi Qingyi: By the way, I was just focused on talking to you

430
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:11,814
I still don't know your name yet.

431
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,798
(Original soundtrack of Tan Xuling: Ask your name)

432
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:19,717
Shi Qingyi: my name is Shi Qingyi. What's your name?

433
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:24,320
Luo Shen: (Unhappy) You said you are Shi Qingyi,

434
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,780
Why don't you know my name?

435
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,639
Shi Qingyi: (Confused) My name is Shi Qingyi,

436
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,810
My family gave it to me.

437
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,430
What does it have to do with whether I know your name?

438
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:43,823
Luo Shen: (Dejected) My name is Luo Shen.

439
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,880
Remember it, don't forget it.

440
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,400
Shi Qingyi: **The Goddes of Luoshui?**

441
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,520
**What a unique name.**

442
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,054
Shi Qingyi: Luoshen, it's a rare name,

443
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:01,225
Of course I won't forget. I'll remember it.

444
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,248
Luo Shen: (Lost) Okay.

445
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:06,448
That's good.

446
00:25:07,448 --> 00:25:09,473
Shi Qingyi: (Inexplicably distressed) **I asked her name,**

447
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:12,298
**Why does she look …**

448
00:25:13,198 --> 00:25:15,123
**A little sad?**

449
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:20,673
Luo Shen: Miss Shi.

450
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:24,265
Why did you bring me here,

451
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,498
And said you wanted to help me,

452
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,803
Just now, you also helped me avoid prison.

453
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:33,768
You and I don't know each other,

454
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:37,118
And my identity is very special,

455
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:40,673
You are so kind to me,

456
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,398
But what's your intention?

457
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:45,878
Shi Qingyi: I won't beat around the bush with you.

458
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,378
I do have an ulterior motive,

459
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:50,823
But it's not malicious. Don't worry.

460
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:52,113
Well…

461
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:55,923
I'm interested in you.

462
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:58,747
Luo Shen: Huh?

463
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:03,773
Interested… in me?

464
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,808
Shi Qingyi: I... I didn't mean that. Don't get me wrong.

465
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:10,373
I... I don't have that inclination.

466
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:11,463
Luo Shen: (Sneers)

467
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:16,574
Really? No such inclination.

468
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,975
Shi Qingyi: Did I say something that makes you unhappy?

469
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,600
Luo Shen: No

470
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:31,690
Shi Qingyi: Well... I have something to discuss with you.

471
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,225
Luo Shen: What?

472
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:38,023
I am now preparing a crucial research topic,

473
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:40,448
For my graduate thesis.

474
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,675
Luo Shen: Topic?

475
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:45,729
This so-called topic is equivalent to

476
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,260
It's equivalent to the essays that students wrote to the emperor 

477
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,889
for imperial examination in the Ming Dynasty, so it is very important.

478
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:57,938
Whether you can get the favor and appreciation of the emperor,

479
00:26:57,938 --> 00:27:00,919
Depends on that essay.

480
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:02,575
Do you understand me?

481
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:05,175
Luo Shen: Yes.

482
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:06,939
On this subject,

483
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:08,059
I've chosen

484
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,948
"local customs and political culture

485
00:27:09,948 --> 00:27:13,298
About the cultural relics unearthed in the Ming Dynasty".

486
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:18,023
Therefore, I hope you can help me complete this research topic.

487
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:27,229
Shi Qingyi: **she... Why is she keeping silent again?**

488
00:27:28,902 --> 00:27:33,262
Shi Qingyi: It's just... I want to hire you as my archaeological data provider,

489
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:37,208
I'd like to ask you for help and provide detailed cultural and local information about your Dynasty.

490
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,293
Of course, as a thank-you, I'll pay you a salary,

491
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:41,927
Salary means wages, which means silver.

492
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:45,178
At the same time, I'll provide you with life consulting services in this era,

493
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:48,088
So that you can understand and adapt to this strange world as soon as possible.

494
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:51,228
Miss Luo, this is a win-win situation,

495
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:54,648
I hope you can consider accepting my offer.

496
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:56,989
Shi Qingyi: **What a good deal.**

497
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:59,239
**Even if you're a piece of wood,**

498
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:01,764
**It's time to nod your head.**

499
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,289
**(Continuous silence)**

500
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,410
**What a piece of wood,**

501
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:10,314
**No, she's an iceberg with facial paralysis.**

502
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,719
**I just said so much,**

503
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:14,788
**Why isn't she saying a word,**

504
00:28:14,788 --> 00:28:16,919
**Didn't give me even a look.**

505
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:22,428
Shi Qingyi: Miss Luo,

506
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:25,369
Do you understand me?

507
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:30,154
Luo Shen: Yes.

508
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:32,779
Shi Qingyi: Are you willing to promise?

509
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:36,430
Luo Shen: I want to take a bath.

510
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,665
Shi Qingyi: What?

511
00:28:38,404 --> 00:28:40,243
Luo Shen: I'm so dirty,

512
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:44,019
Excuse me, miss Shi, where can I bathe?

513
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:49,294
Shi Qingyi: I'll take you to the bathing place.

514
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:51,275
Luo Shen: Thanks a lot.

515
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:55,329
Shi Qingyi: It's time to drive, you're probably still not used to it

516
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:58,003
Let me fasten it for you, ok?

517
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,125
Luo Shen: Yes.

518
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:01,525
Shi Qingyi: (Gently  telling) In modern society,

519
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:03,564
Traffic rules must be observed,

520
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:06,042
This seat belt must be fastened.

521
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:09,919
You see, that's it.

522
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:14,718
Luo Shen: (Sighs)

523
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:17,437
Shi Qingyi: (Take a deep cold breath) What?

524
00:29:17,437 --> 00:29:18,639
**Why did she**

525
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:22,619
**Suddenly put her hand on my shoulder?**

526
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,744
**Her hands are... so cold.**

527
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,539
Shi Qingyi: Miss Luo,

528
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:36,120
You... Your hand,

529
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,919
Can you put it down?

530
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:42,420
Luo Shen: You're pressing against my body like this,

531
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,295
I don't know where to put my hand.

532
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:48,825
Shi Qingyi: **You don't know where to put your hand,**

533
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:51,415
**Is it comfortable for you to put it on my shoulder?**

534
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,950
Shi Qingyi: I... I didn't mean to press against you,

535
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:59,030
It's... Because I need to help you fasten your seat belt,

536
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,249
I have to lean over.

537
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:02,844
Luo Shen: Yes.

538
00:30:05,894 --> 00:30:07,719
Put it down.

539
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:14,133
Shi Qingyi: **This woman,**

540
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:16,593
**Why do I feel that she's groping me**

541
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:18,817
**Not only does she not obey the traffic laws,**

542
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,094
**But also taking advantage of me?**

543
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:23,940
**I can't  forgive such…**

544
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,200
**Outrageous behavior…**

545
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,440
**Just because she's an ancient…**

546
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,344
Luo Shen: Miss Shi.

547
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:31,673
Shi Qingyi: What?

548
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:34,703
Luo Shen: Don't you want to take me somewhere where I can take a bath?

549
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:38,494
Shi Qingyi: Er, yes, let's go now.

550
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:42,809
Luo Shen: (Chuckles) **Qingyi.**

551
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:47,121
**It doesn't matter if you don't remember me.**

552
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:52,896
**I'll let you know me again.**

553
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:16,150
(Shi Qingyi's home)

554
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,790
Shi Qingyi: Miss Luo, this is where I live,

555
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,435
Do as you like, Miss Luo.

556
00:31:22,435 --> 00:31:23,832
Luo Shen:Okay.

557
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,075
Luo Shen: (A little relieved)

558
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:35,862
**Fortunately, there are only Qingyi's shoes here.**

559
00:31:37,444 --> 00:31:40,569
Shi Qingyi: Wear these slippers. They are new.

560
00:31:41,194 --> 00:31:42,834
Luo Shen: You live alone?

561
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,720
Shi Qingyi: How did you discover this?

562
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:46,465
Luo Shen: (Flickering smile) Miss Shi,

563
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:50,644
You seem quite familiar with the ancient tongue

564
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:53,953
Shi Qingyi: I mean, how did you find out?

565
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:56,315
Luo Shen: There are not many shoes here,

566
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,230
And all of them fit your size, so I guessed.

567
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,644
Shi Qingyi: You can tell the size of my shoes at a glance?

568
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,294
Luo Shen: (Whispering) I know all your sizes.

569
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:14,819
Shi Qingyi: (Goes farther) What? What did you just say?

570
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:17,344
Luo Shen: Nothing.

571
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,184
Shi Qingyi: Miss Luo, sit down please.

572
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:22,624
Luo Shen: Yes.

573
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,994
(Shi Qingyi prepares various drinks)

574
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,515
Shi Qingyi: (Excited) **I can't believe it,**

575
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:37,115
**I brought home an ancient woman from the tomb,**

576
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:40,779
**A woman belonging to the Ming Dynasty.**

577
00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:43,688
**As long as Luo Shen agrees to cooperate with me,**

578
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:48,548
**I can get so much precious historical information from her.**

579
00:32:48,548 --> 00:32:50,818
**This is living history.**

580
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:53,394
**I have to coax her.**

581
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,679
Shi Qingyi: (Smiling) You must be thirsty. Have a drink.

582
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,194
What kind do you like?

583
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:01,723
I don't know your tastes. You choose it yourself,

584
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:05,804
I think you may not be used to carbonated drinks,

585
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:07,444
So I didn't get that for you.

586
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,313
Luoshen: Just milk.

587
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:12,948
Shi Qingyi: Milk? 

588
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:16,144
What did milk taste like in your Ming Dynasty?

589
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,689
What's the difference between then and now?

590
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:20,690
Shi Qingyi: **In ancient times,**

591
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,760
**Only the upper class or well-off people can afford milk,**

592
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:28,290
**It seems that she must have been very rich in the Ming Dynasty.**

593
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,020
Luo Shen: I want another drink.

594
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:31,694
Shi Qingyi: (Interrupted) What?

595
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,164
Luo Shen: Milk.

596
00:33:34,164 --> 00:33:38,044
Shi Qingyi: Oh, OK, wait a minute. I'll pour it for you.

597
00:33:40,744 --> 00:33:43,019
Shi Qingyi: **Does she like milk so much?**

598
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,944
**She even wants two glasses.**

599
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:55,244
Shi Qingyi: Miss Luo, here is the milk.

600
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:57,394
Luo Shen: You drink.

601
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:58,669
Shi Qingyi: Ah?

602
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,379
Luo Shen: Don't you like milk?

603
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:04,275
This one is for you.

604
00:34:04,865 --> 00:34:06,065
Shi Qingyi: **Strange**

605
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:09,969
How did she know I like milk, too?

606
00:34:10,294 --> 00:34:13,375
Luo Shen: Don't you like it?

607
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,460
Shi Qingyi: I like it

608
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:23,471
Luo Shen: The question you asked me about the milk just now

609
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,155
I'll answer you now

610
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:26,965
Shifu Qingyi: Yes, okay.

611
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:31,642
Luo Shen: During the Ming Dynasty, milk had a heavy fishy smell

612
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:34,275
and a faint smell of rawness

613
00:34:34,735 --> 00:34:39,505
But your milk here is different, it has a mild taste

614
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:42,788
but it does also have a distinctive

615
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:45,968
tasty flavour 

616
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:48,351
Shi Qingyi: (smiles gently)

617
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,627
Luo Shen: Why are you looking at me like that?

618
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,667
Shifu Qingyi: I think you are very special

619
00:34:56,396 --> 00:35:00,055
Luo Shen: Is that so? Why am I special?

620
00:35:00,553 --> 00:35:05,685
Shifu Qingyi: Miss Luo, I think you are very interesting

621
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:07,285
Luo Shen: Oh?

622
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:13,397
Shifu Qingyi: If I were a Ming dynasty person and I woke up from a dream and walked out of a tomb

623
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:18,627
And saw that everything was different outside, I would have felt panic and anxiety in my heart.

624
00:35:18,627 --> 00:35:22,704
But you are different, you don't seem to care

625
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:28,096
Luo Shen: It's very common for dynasties to change.

626
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:31,997
It's just a law of creation.

627
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:35,777
As history progresses, dynasties change

628
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:38,217
The outside world is also changing rapidly

629
00:35:38,217 --> 00:35:42,026
I'm used to it, it's no big deal

630
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:47,587
Even though I might be in the harshness of the sand dunes

631
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:49,877
Or snowy mountains

632
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:53,607
Or in one of your new dynasties

633
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:56,753
I don't think there's anything wrong with that

634
00:35:57,143 --> 00:36:00,013
If I don't understand what's around me,

635
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:05,286
I'll learn, until I understand it, and I'll get used to it

636
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:10,516
Even if the outside world changes, people have to live.

637
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,824
There's no need to panic

638
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:19,947
Shi Qingyi: You're really different from ordinary people, that's why I think you're special

639
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,377
But you just said "I'm used to seeing it"?

640
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:30,467
I don't know if my understanding is biased

641
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:33,417
What you said, it seems mean ......

642
00:36:33,807 --> 00:36:38,540
You've been through a lot of dynasties changing, haven't you?

643
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:43,763
Luo Shen: You didn't misunderstand.

644
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:49,050
I have been through the change of dynasties often

645
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:54,789
From the Warring States to the Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty

646
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,918
Almost two thousand years.

647
00:36:58,374 --> 00:37:01,174
This kind of dynastic change

648
00:37:01,174 --> 00:37:05,443
I've seen a lot of it and I'm used to it

649
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:10,584
But what do you expect?

650
00:37:10,974 --> 00:37:14,902
Shi Qingyi: Miss Luo, I can't believe you ......

651
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,960
You're also quite good at telling jokes

652
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:21,897
**You’re not immortal**

653
00:37:21,897 --> 00:37:26,761
**How can you have lived through the Warring States, the Tang Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty?**

654
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:31,119
**You've experienced all the changes of the dynasties**

655
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:33,994
**Itmust be just a joke**

656
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,228
Luo Shen: I was indeed telling a joke

657
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:39,571
Qing ......

658
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:44,675
Miss Shi, did you like it?

659
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:49,311
Shi Qingyi: I thought you were from the Ming Dynasty

660
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:53,646
I didn't expect you to cross over from the Warring States to the Ming Dynasty

661
00:37:54,427 --> 00:37:57,507
Chinese history is only about 5,000 years old

662
00:37:57,507 --> 00:38:01,534
You've taken up almost 2,000 years, almost half of it

663
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:05,695
I really admire ......

664
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:10,987
Luo Shen: Do you think I'm not clear-headed and talking nonsense?

665
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:12,477
Of course I don't

666
00:38:12,477 --> 00:38:17,307
I'm not three years old, would I believe you, the queen of groan worthy jokes?

667
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:21,614
And you say you're over 2,000 years old, are you an old spirit?

668
00:38:21,614 --> 00:38:24,097
(Luo Shen laughs gently and presses Shi Qingyi onto the sofa)

669
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:25,680
Shi Qingyi: Huh?...... you ...... you

670
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,287
Luo Shen: (gazing at Shi Qingyi, breathing up and down)

671
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:31,697
Shi Qingyi : **She ...... she just suddenly pinned me to the sofa**

672
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:34,135
**What the hell does she want to do?**

673
00:38:34,135 --> 00:38:35,014
The original soundtrack of Tan Xu Ling: Seeing Luo

674
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:36,813
(Shi Qingyi tries to push Luo Shen away gently)

675
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:38,657
Luo Shen: (pushed lightly by Shi Qingyi, holding back a slight gasp)

676
00:38:38,657 --> 00:38:42,557
Shi Qingyi: (torn) **Hey, should I ...... push her away?**

677
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:46,405
**It seems ...... like it's not very polite**

678
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:52,151
**But she pinning me down like this, she ...... is not polite either**

679
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:58,331
**She ...... smells so good**

680
00:38:58,851 --> 00:39:02,634
**No, I ...... what am I thinking about?**

681
00:39:05,597 --> 00:39:09,377
Shi Qingyi: What do you want to do, I am a good citizen

682
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:13,607
Miss Luo, I hope you can learn from me too

683
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:16,235
Be a good citizen

684
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:18,326
Luo Shen: (smiles meaningfully)

685
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:21,267
Shi Qingyi: (nervous)

686
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,504
Luo Shen: I don't want to do anything

687
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:27,875
I just remembered I should bathe

688
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:31,677
Good citizen Miss Shi

689
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:33,255
Shifu Qingyi: ...... Yes?

690
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:37,127
(Luo Shen gets up from the sofa)

691
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:41,019
Shi Qingyi: (puzzled) Why is this person so odd sometimes

692
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:43,687
The original soundtrack of Tanxuling: Qingxuan

693
00:39:43,687 --> 00:39:47,541
Shi Qingyi: The bathroom is over there, I'll take you there

694
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:48,848
Luo Shen: Hmm.

695
00:39:53,537 --> 00:39:54,377
(Luo Shen looks at Shi Qingyi's back and laughs lightly)

Shi Qingyi: I didn't expect her to take the initiative so quickly

702
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,909
Why does it feel like she's a hunter?

703
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:10,027
And I'm like the prey she's after?

704
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:13,719
Luo Shen: It seems that Miss Shi has studied my subject here

705
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:16,607
and already done a lot of research

706
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:21,613
Next time, do you want to study somewhere else?
